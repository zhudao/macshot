# Changelog

## [4.2.0-beta.8] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Fix crash on launch on macOS versions older than 12.3 where ScreenCaptureKit is unavailable (weak-link the framework).

## [4.2.0-beta.7] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Custom aspect-ratio lock: in the aspect-ratio presets, a "Custom" option locks the current selection's exact ratio, so you can type a width and height and then resize while keeping that proportion.
- History can be ordered by last edit (Settings, on by default): editing a screenshot moves it to the top of the history panel. Turn it off to keep capture order.
- Hold Space while dragging to move the whole selection, and boundary snap now applies when moving a selection (not just resizing).

### Fixed

- The editor no longer asks "Save changes?" when you close it without having made any edits.
- Moving, resizing, or rotating an existing annotation is now undoable and correctly counts as an edit.
- The editor's "Done" button only appears once you've actually made an edit.
- Capture reliability on macOS 26.

## [4.2.0-beta.6] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Loupe: click + drag to create a rooted two-circle magnifier — a source circle stays where you click and the magnified lens follows your drag, connected by a line. Both circles move and resize independently, the source always frames exactly what the lens shows, and there's an outline color option for the rings and line. (#197)

### Fixed

- The enlarged "shake to find" / accessibility mouse cursor is no longer captured when "Capture mouse cursor" is off.
- Clicking a toolbar button that opened a popover (beautify gradient, adjust/effects, color pickers, etc.) now closes it instead of reopening.
- The right-side toolbar no longer gets placed under the notch on MacBooks that have one.

## [4.2.0-beta.5] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Paste a clipboard image directly into the Editor window with Cmd+V.

### Changed

- Boundary snap is now enabled by default.
- Removed the Liquid Glass theme. Toolbars, popovers, and HUDs use the standard solid appearance everywhere.

### Fixed

- Clicking the scroll-capture HUD no longer steals focus from the window being captured.

## [4.2.0-beta.4] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Boundary snap — when enabled, the capture selection's edges snap to strong color edges in the image (UI lines, window borders) while you drag or resize it. Off by default (Settings → Capture); hold Option to bypass.

### Fixed

- Menu bar icon could freeze the app and stop the global hotkey from working.
- Number tool no longer draws a handle dot over the digit while selected.

## [4.2.0-beta.3] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Highlight (spotlight) tool — drag a rectangle to keep that region bright while dimming the rest of the capture. Adjustable dim strength and a solid/dashed border.

### Changed

- Removed scroll/pinch-to-zoom from the capture overlay (the editor window still zooms).
- Selected text now shows a plain selection rectangle instead of an outline tracing the letters.

### Fixed

- Clicking outside a text box closes it without dropping a new empty text box where you clicked.
- Text no longer clips at the bottom when a text box is resized to its minimum height.

## [4.2.0-beta.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Resolution W×H fields are editable again in Liquid Glass mode (typing no longer beeps).
- Removed a stray duplicate resolution box that appeared in the bottom-left corner.

## [4.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Native AVIF export.
- Custom menu bar icon — the default, a built-in preset, or any SF Symbol.
- OCR now detects QR codes too, with open/copy/scan actions.
- Right-click menu for history screenshots: copy, save, edit, pin, upload, OCR/QR, rotate, flip, open with, share, delete.
- Pre-draw aspect-ratio/resolution preset button for quick and scroll capture.
- Window snapping can select Finder Quick Look windows.
- Silent "Clear History" hotkey.
- Forward Delete for annotations.
- Point handles for number annotations; improved loupe controls.
- Settings: configurable save action, hide shadow outside selection, show shortcuts in tooltips.

### Changed

- Redesigned selection size control: split width/height fields, presets, recording-friendly.
- Resolution preset popovers behave like real controls (focus, Escape, dismissal, glass state); preset choice is shared between pre-draw and selected-area popovers.
- Exact-resolution pre-draw capture drags as a fixed-size frame.
- OCR/QR results UI aligns with Translate, actions moved into the header.
- Toolbars stay attached to the selection without overlapping; Liquid Glass covers the size/resolution toolbar.
- Idle sleep allowed again. Text fields use the standard edit menu.

### Fixed

- Fixed-resolution preset no longer leaks into the next capture when "keep ratio" is off.
- Liquid Glass popovers interact on first click; Remember Last Tool respected.
- Double-click text editing no longer copies accidentally.
- Resolution fields keep edits and focus; readout no longer overlaps the right toolbar.
- Save panel opens focused; history overlay dismisses before external image actions.
- Editable annotations and post-processing state preserved when reopening captures; Save/Done state updates correctly.
- Toolbar buttons no longer fire stale actions or leave random hover/pressed states; tooltips no longer flash.
- Space-to-move works after resizing; toolbar layout recalculates after preset changes.
- Window snapping ignores hidden windows behind the frontmost one.

## [4.1.3-beta.1] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Liquid Glass theme** (macOS 26 Tahoe) — a new Settings → Appearance toggle that renders the capture toolbars, the tool options row, popovers, and recording/scroll HUDs as Apple's translucent Liquid Glass material. Independent of the toolbar color customization; only appears on macOS 26+. Off by default.

### Fixed

- **Thin edge line on Beautify screenshots** — with a drop shadow enabled, a faint hairline appeared around the rounded screenshot edges (white on dark captures, dark on light). The shadow is now cast from the screenshot's own rounded shape, so there's no rim.

## [4.1.2] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Pin from Clipboard** — pin whatever is on the clipboard (image or text) as a floating window, from the menu bar or a configurable hotkey. Thanks @chablino (#210).
- **Hide capture instructions** — a Settings → General toggle to hide the on-screen capture hint text (#226).

### Fixed

- **macshot no longer quits itself when left idle in the background** — the menu bar process was eligible for memory-pressure (Jetsam) termination. Thanks @PINKIIILQWQ (#132, #222).
- **Stuck invisible overlay swallowing all clicks** — after waking from sleep, a leftover transparent overlay could intercept every click on a display until macshot was quit. Idle overlays are now click-through (#231).
- **First selection drag no longer swallowed** — starting a selection over the previous position of hidden toolbar chrome could silently fail. Thanks @chablino (#219).
- **Overlay zoom-in animation with Reduce Motion** — the capture overlay briefly scaled in (visible at the screen edges) when the system "Reduce Motion" setting was on. It now appears instantly (#205).
- **Number tool now resets after deleting** — deleting numbered annotations and adding a new one restarts the sequence instead of continuing to climb (#211).
- **Silent save failures** — saving a screenshot when no save folder was authorized could fail silently in the sandbox. macshot now prompts for a folder once, then saves there. Thanks @jeffreylyg (#177).

## [4.1.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Sketchy arrow style** — hand-drawn-looking arrow option in the arrow style picker.
- **Double-click selection to copy** — double-click inside the selection to copy the screenshot. On by default; togglable in Settings → General.
- **Extra Large webcam size** — XL added next to Small/Medium/Large (#199).
- **Capture menu ordering** — reorder the actions in the menu bar menu from Settings.

### Changed

- **Faster cold-start captures** — the overlay shows up promptly and accepts the first drag without lag, even after a long idle.

### Fixed

- **Scroll capture** — the HUD has been hidden behind the overlay since v3.4.5 and the overlay was eating scroll events. Both fixed.
- **Save As no longer hijacks the default screenshots folder** — a one-off Save As destination used to replace the configured default. It's now a one-time choice (#168).
- **Webcam preview during recording setup** — the live webcam panel now appears in the right corner of the selection before you press record, not only after.
- **Phantom "Screen Recording" notifications** — beta.1's background prewarm triggered the macOS Sequoia indicator every 20 seconds. The prewarm is gone; macshot only reads the screen when you trigger a capture.
- **Transient UI capture** — hotkey captures preserve disappearing UI such as Raycast, Alfred, app menus, and the Apple menu.
- **Focus returns to the previous app** after confirming or cancelling a capture.
- **Floating thumbnails no longer leak into the next capture.**
- **Preview Save panel** — Save now brings its dialog to the front on the first click.
- **Copy and Pin no longer replay the capture sound.**
- **OCR fallback** — if accurate recognition fails, macshot retries with fast recognition.
- **Video editor text** — double-click editing keeps alignment and background styling stable.

## [4.1.1-beta.4] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Sketchy arrow style** — a new hand-drawn-looking arrow option in the arrow style picker, rendered from a real hand-drawn SVG so it actually looks handmade.

### Fixed

- **Scroll capture** — the HUD has been hidden behind the overlay since v3.4.5 and the overlay was capturing scroll events instead of passing them through, making scroll capture unusable. Both fixed.
- **Save As no longer hijacks the default screenshots folder** — picking a one-off location with Save As used to permanently replace the configured default. It is now treated as a one-time choice; the default is only changed from Settings. (Reported in #168.)
- **Cold-start hotkey lag** — fixed in two layers: macshot now disables App Nap so it stays responsive after long idle, and the overlay window is now a persistent per-screen NSPanel so WindowServer's composition cache stays warm across captures.

## [4.1.1-beta.3] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Phantom "Macshot: Screen Recording" notifications** — the periodic capture-path prewarm introduced in 4.1.1-beta.1 was triggering the macOS Sequoia Screen Recording usage indicator every 20 seconds even when no capture was active. The prewarm has been removed; macshot now only reads the screen when you actually trigger a capture.

### Changed

- **Capture pipeline simplification** — window creation and screenshot capture now run in parallel from the hotkey, replacing the layered cold-start workarounds added in earlier 4.1.1 betas. Cold-start latency is improved without any background work between captures.

## [4.1.1-beta.2] - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- **Hotkey capture overlay startup** — global-hotkey captures now show an interactive overlay immediately, even after a cold launch or several idle minutes.
- **Immediate capture rendering** — the overlay can accept selection input before the full preview surface finishes installing, while still using the full-resolution screenshot for copy, save, editor, and upload output.

### Fixed

- **First drag delay after hotkey capture** — added an early mouse-input path for the capture overlay so macOS/AppKit input lag after Carbon hotkeys no longer blocks starting the selection.
- **Spinner/old cursor during capture startup** — the capture cursor is now asserted while the overlay is coming up.

## [4.1.1-beta.1] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Capture menu ordering** — reorder the capture actions shown in the menu bar menu from Settings.
- **Missing webcam size localization keys** — added the camera overlay size string to all bundled languages.

### Changed

- **Faster cold screenshot overlay** — pre-capture the screen before activation, keep the WindowServer capture path warm while idle, and avoid blocking the overlay on full redraw work.
- **Preview actions scale with preview size** — Copy and Save controls now resize with the screenshot preview size setting.

### Fixed

- **Transient UI capture** — hotkey captures now preserve disappearing UI such as Raycast, Alfred, app menus, and the Apple menu.
- **Previous app focus restore** — completing or cancelling a capture returns focus to the app that was active before macshot opened the overlay.
- **Floating thumbnails no longer leak into the next capture** while preserving fast capture startup.
- **Preview Save panel activation** — Save now brings its dialog to the front on the first click.
- **Preview Copy and Pin sounds** — these actions no longer replay the capture sound.
- **Video text editing style** — double-click editing keeps alignment and background styling stable instead of switching to an ugly editing style.
- **OCR fallback** — if accurate recognition fails, macshot retries quickly with fast recognition.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-05-08

The big release in 4.1.0 is a full **video editor effects suite**: zoom, censor, cut, speed, freeze, and text segments rendered through a custom Core Image compositor. Recording quality, color reproduction across external monitors, and capture-flow ergonomics also got significant attention.

### Added

- **Video editor effects suite** — six segment types you can stack on the timeline:
    - **Zoom** segments with direct-manipulation rect on the preview, fade in/out, 1.2×–5× range.
    - **Censor** segments — solid / pixelate / blur a rectangular region for a time range. Two censors can overlap.
    - **Cut** segments — physically remove a range of frames from the export.
    - **Speed** segments — retime a range at 0.25×–10×, audio stays in sync.
    - **Freeze** segments — hold a single source frame for a chosen duration.
    - **Text** segments — overlay styled text (size, bold/italic, color, background pill, alignment, fade) anywhere on the video, with double-click to edit in place.
- **Multi-row effects band** — overlapping segments stack into separate rows; up to 4 rows visible, scrolls vertically beyond that.
- **Custom video compositor** — single Core Image render path shared by live preview, MP4 export, and GIF export. Smooth motion, filter-based effects (blur/pixelate) alongside transform-based zoom.
- **Video export quality presets** (Low / Medium / High) and **export dimensions dropdown** (Original, 75%, 50%, 33%, 25%) with estimated output size.
- **Right-click to anchor capture rect** — right-click an empty overlay to start a selection, then move the cursor without holding any button.
- **Capture Last Area** — re-capture the previous selection on demand from the menu bar, hotkey, or `macshot://capture-last`.
- **URL scheme for external tools** — `macshot://capture`, `macshot://ocr`, `macshot://record`, etc. Trigger from Raycast, Alfred, BetterTouchTool, Shortcuts.
- **Customizable toolbar background color** with adaptive light/dark appearance.
- **`{random}` filename token** — 8-character base36 string per file in screenshot/recording filename templates.
- **Per-glyph Stroke control** for the text tool, alongside Fill and Outline.
- **11 new configurable overlay shortcuts** — Pin (defaults to F), Upload (U), Copy, Save, OCR, Scroll Capture, Beautify, Invert Colors, Remove Background, Translate, Undo, Redo. Configurable in Settings → Shortcuts.
- **Keyboard navigation in the history overlay** — arrows, Enter/Cmd+C to copy, Cmd+E to open in editor, Space for Quick Look, Delete to remove.
- **Dock right-click shows each window individually** — editor, video editor, and preferences windows each appear as their own menu item.
- **"Open Video…" menu entry** — open a user-owned video in the editor for trimming, effects, and export without touching the source.
- **Copy Screen Info** in Settings → About — copies display and capture diagnostics for bug reports.
- **DMG drag-to-install layout** with arrow background, plus a "Move to Applications" prompt when launched from a translocated path.

### Changed

- **Recording bitrate increased** so screen content stays crisp. New tiers target ~12 / ~22 / ~40 Mbit/s at 1440p30 for low/medium/high. B-frames disabled (standard tuning for screen content). Closes #140.
- **Recording color space** is now forced to sRGB at capture time (macOS 14+), fixing washed-out playback on Display P3 screens.
- **Faster first capture** — Core Animation/Metal pipeline pre-warmed at app launch; ScreenCaptureKit content cache no longer bypassed on every capture; instant transparent overlay while screenshots load in the background.
- **Background windows no longer jump forward when triggering a capture** — editor/preferences/Sparkle windows stay behind the user's frontmost app.
- **Clicking a history entry shows the floating thumbnail** for visual confirmation, instead of silently copying with no feedback. Closes #133.
- **Sparkle update check interval reduced from 30 minutes to 24 hours** so update prompts don't reappear constantly during release windows.

### Fixed

- **Wrong colors on external monitors** (editor + saved files) — captured screenshots are now normalized to sRGB at capture time. Some external monitors (e.g. ViewSonic VX4380) have ICC profiles that don't round-trip correctly through AppKit's rendering pipeline.
- **Editor fits large images to the window on open.** Multi-megapixel images (e.g. 24MP photos via Photos.app "Edit in macshot") previously showed only the top-left corner. Closes #161.
- **Clicking outside the selection no longer wipes annotation progress.** A recurring source of lost work — outside clicks are now a no-op when a selection already exists; ESC still cancels deliberately. Closes #154.
- **Stroke width, line style, arrow style, shape fill, corner radius, and arrow Flip now persist globally** even when an annotation is selected. Refs #58.
- **Tmp-file accumulation** — clipboard intermediates, share-sheet temps, cancelled recordings, and sandbox quarantine stubs all accumulated indefinitely. A new launch-time sweep keeps tmp at a few hundred KB steady state (was up to 1.2 GB). Closes #128.
- **Settings window clipping** in Polish, German, Dutch, and other long-string locales. Closes #130.
- **GIF export crash on longer recordings**, **GIF export freezes the UI**, and **GIF export shows no progress** — switched to a real background thread, fixed a use-after-free in finalize, added a percentage indicator.
- **S3 and Google Drive image uploads ignored the filename template** — both now read the same `filenameTemplate` UserDefault that local saves use. Closes #147.
- **Last used tool not persisted across app restarts** — selected annotation tool now survives via UserDefaults.
- **Focus not returning to previous app** after capture, and **window snap highlight race condition** on the pre-screenshot transparent overlay.
- **Color dithering in pinned images and editor window** — disabled `AutomaticAppKit` layer content format in favor of explicit `RGBA8` for pixel-perfect color reproduction.

## [4.1.0-beta.8] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Quick Capture's "Also open in Editor" was resetting last-used tool and stroke width.** `DetachedEditorWindowController.open(...)` had `tool: .arrow` / `strokeWidth: 3` as parameter defaults and unconditionally wrote them to the new EditorView on every open, which triggered the `currentTool` didSet that persists globally — so opening the editor (Quick Capture, History → Open in Editor, Pin → Edit) silently overwrote `lastUsedTool` and `currentStrokeWidth` for the entire app. Parameters are now optional with `nil` default; the editor only overrides when a caller explicitly passes a value, otherwise the EditorView's own UserDefaults-backed initializers are honored. Refs #58.

## [4.1.0-beta.7] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Per-glyph Stroke control for the text tool** — alongside the existing Fill and Outline toggles, a third "Stroke" swatch+toggle draws a stroke around each character via `NSAttributedString` `.strokeColor` / `.strokeWidth`. Persists across captures, propagates to selected text annotations, and is preserved through clone/codable for undo and history reload.

### Changed
- **Recording bitrate increased so screen content stays crisp.** The bppf-based model assumed screen recordings are low-entropy, but H.264 softens sharp text edges below ~0.30 bppf the moment any motion enters the frame. Defaults (.high, 1440p30) were producing ~21 Mbit/s vs. the ~40 Mbit/s industry-standard. New tiers target ~12 / ~22 / ~40 Mbit/s at 1440p30 for low/medium/high. B-frames disabled (standard tuning for screen content). File sizes for `.high` roughly double — the right tradeoff for a tier explicitly named "High". Closes #140.
- **Sparkle update check interval reduced from 30 minutes to 24 hours** so update prompts don't reappear constantly during release windows.

### Fixed
- **Editor fits large images to the window on open.** Opening a multi-megapixel image (e.g. a 24MP photo via Photos.app "Edit in macshot") presented only the top-left corner because the EditorView document was sized to full image dimensions while the scroll view stayed at 1× magnification. The fit-to-viewport magnification is now computed on open and applied when < 1.0; small images keep 1× so they aren't upscaled. Closes #161.
- **Clicking outside the selection no longer wipes annotation progress.** Once a selection rect is committed, clicking in the dimmed area outside the rect previously dropped all annotations and started a new selection from that point — a recurring source of lost work. Treat outside clicks as a no-op when a selection already exists; ESC still cancels deliberately. Closes #154.
- **Video editor effects no longer silently no-op** when the AVAsset's tracks haven't finished parsing. The synchronous `asset.tracks(withMediaType:)` accessor on a freshly-finalized recording could return an empty array before the moov atom was parsed; the effects composition then cached a stale trackID and `sourceFrame(byTrackID:)` returned nil. Switched to async `load(.tracks)` and built dimensions, duration, player item, and compositor state from the resolved track.
- **S3 and Google Drive image uploads ignored the filename template.** Both uploaders hardcoded `"Screenshot {YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss}.png"`, so user templates (`{unix}`, `{random}`, `{window}`, etc.) didn't apply. Image uploads now read the same `filenameTemplate` UserDefault that local saves use, matching the convention video uploads already follow. imgbb intentionally unchanged — its API doesn't accept a filename. Closes #147.
- **Changing the censor mode on a selected censor rect now updates it.** The mode segment in the censor tool's options bar wrote to UserDefaults but ignored the selected annotation; reading was symmetric (always showed the global default, never the annotation's actual mode). Selected censor rects now re-bake on mode change and the segment shows the annotation's current mode while it's selected.

## [4.1.0-beta.6] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **`{random}` filename token** — screenshot and recording filename templates now support a `{random}` placeholder that renders a fresh 8-character lowercase base36 string per file. Closes #136.

### Changed
- **Clicking a history entry in the menu bar now shows the floating thumbnail** for visual confirmation, instead of silently copying to clipboard with no feedback. The thumbnail's Edit action opens the original history entry. Closes #133.

### Fixed
- **Stroke width, line style, arrow style, shape fill, corner radius, and arrow Flip now persist globally even when an annotation is selected.** Changing these while editing an existing annotation only mutated that annotation — the UserDefaults write was in an `else` branch that never ran in edit mode — so the next capture reverted to whatever was last persisted (stroke defaulted to 3). Refs #58.
- **"Enable macshot:// URL scheme" checkbox was not localized** (raw string literal, not wrapped in `L()`). Also added the missing `"Save Recording"` key that was referenced in `AppDelegate` but absent from every `.strings` file. Closes #134.

## [4.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Video editor export with freeze frames** — saving or uploading a video that contained a freeze failed with "Export failed" because `AVAssetExportSession` choked on the 600× `scaleTimeRange` a freeze bakes into the composition track. Freezes now route through the custom video compositor, which uses its time map to serve the same source frame for every composition time during the hold — matching how preview already renders them.

## [4.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Freeze-frame effect in the video editor** — hold a single source frame for a chosen duration (0.25s, 0.5s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s presets, 0.1–30s range). Shown on the effects band as a violet snowflake pill anchored at the source moment. Works alongside cuts and speeds: a freeze inside a speed segment splits it, a freeze inside a cut is silently dropped. Audio goes silent during the hold, matching what viewers expect.

### Changed
- **Zoom effect now zooms into the area you actually drew** — previously the rect was vertically mirrored at render time because the overlay coordinates (y-down) and CIImage transforms (y-up) hadn't been reconciled.
- **"Open in Finder" on recording stop reveals the file in your configured recording directory** (or screenshot save dir, or via a Save panel) — not the sandbox tmp folder. Files become something you can actually find and keep.
- **Clipboard copy uses a nicely named file** (`Screenshot 2026-04-18 at 18-33.png` inside `tmp/macshot-clipboard/`) overwritten on each copy. Finder paste no longer nags "A newer item named 'macshot-clipboard.png' already exists."
- **Video editor time labels now sit above the trim bar** with 4pt breathing room, so the "Copied to clipboard!" status banner doesn't crowd the effects band below.
- **Video editor playback is ~17% lighter on the main thread** — timeline thumbnails are pre-composited into a single cached strip, and the 30Hz playhead observer now invalidates only the trim-bar stripe so the bottom button row stays off the per-frame draw path.
- **Settings window widened 560 → 620pt, label column 140 → 180pt, checkbox titles wrap gracefully** so Polish, German, Dutch, and other long translations fit without clipping.

### Fixed
- **Settings window clipping in Polish and other long-string locales** — "Szybkie przechwycenie:" was losing its trailing colon, "Automatycznie zamazuj dane wrażliwe" was being truncated. Closes #130.
- **Tmp-file accumulation** — clipboard intermediates, share-sheet temps, cancelled recordings, and sandbox write-quarantine stubs all accumulated in the sandbox tmp folder indefinitely. A new `LaunchCleanup` framework now sweeps these: fixed-path overwrites for the clipboard and recording-clipboard files, a dedicated `tmp/macshot-share/` subfolder with a 5-minute TTL, and a pattern-based sweep with a 24-hour TTL for everything else. One tester reported 1.2 GB of leftovers before this fix; now it stays at a few hundred KB steady state. Closes #128.
- **History panel orphan files** — past builds sometimes wrote `_preview.png` alongside a history entry without cleaning it up on delete. `ScreenshotHistory` now prunes these on launch by diffing the history dir against `index.json`.

## [4.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Cut segments in the video editor** — remove a range of frames from the exported video. Cuts are temporal (frames physically skipped) and integrate into preview, MP4/GIF export, and upload. Trim bar shows striped red overlays over cut ranges.
- **Speed segments in the video editor** — retime a source range at 0.25×, 0.5×, 0.75×, 2×, 3×, 5×, or 10×. Shared `buildProcessedComposition` pipeline bakes trim + cuts + speed into a single composition via `scaleTimeRange`, keeping video and audio in sync across all three effects.
- **Right-click to anchor capture rect** — right-click an empty overlay to start a selection at that point, then move the cursor without holding any button. Left-click (or a second right-click) commits; ESC cancels. Shift-constrain and Space-reposition work the same as in drag mode. Closes #127.
- **"Open Video…" menu entry** — opens a user-owned video in the editor for trimming / effects / export without touching the source file.
- **Keyboard navigation in the history overlay** — left/right arrows, Enter/Cmd+C to copy, Cmd+E to open in editor, Space for Quick Look, Delete to remove. Hover now updates the keyboard selection so arrow keys always step from wherever the mouse last pointed.
- **Dock right-click shows each window individually** — editor, video editor, and preferences windows each appear as their own menu item; clicking brings that specific window forward.

### Changed
- **Background windows no longer jump forward when triggering a capture** — editor/preferences/Sparkle windows stay behind the user's frontmost app during a screenshot. Stashing only kicks in when another app was frontmost, so screenshotting a macshot window that's already in focus still works.
- **Video editor title now includes the source filename (or timestamp for image editor)** so multiple editor windows are distinguishable in Mission Control and the Window menu.
- **Video editor min width bumped** so the quality dropdown fits without clipping.
- **Video editor time label shows the actual output duration** (post cuts + speed) instead of just the raw trim span.
- **Stronger default blur radius** for censored video regions — previous value left faint shapes visible.
- **High / Medium / Low label in the quality dropdown now follows the UI language** (was always English).

### Fixed
- **Video editor no longer flickers to black** when editing a zoom or censor rect while cuts are present. Player-item swaps are now guarded by a cut/speed topology fingerprint, so rect edits on existing effects stay flicker-free.
- **History panel selection flicker** when mixing mouse hover and arrow keys — hover and keyboard selection now share a single outlined-card state.
- **Settings window filename templates** now persist correctly across close/reopen (were reverting to the default).
- **Video editor status/time label placement** when the effects band grows to multiple rows.

## [4.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Video censor segments** — a new effect type alongside zoom. Define a rectangular region on the video that's obscured for a given time window, with three styles: solid black, pixelate, or gaussian blur. Two censors can overlap to blur different regions simultaneously.
- **Direct-manipulation effect rectangles** — when a zoom or censor segment is selected, drag/resize the rect directly on the video preview. For zoom, the rect defines the zoom target (zoom level is derived from rect size, clamped 1.2×–5×). For censor, the rect defines the region to hide. Replaces the earlier mini-thumbnail popover.
- **Multi-row effects band** — overlapping zooms and censors stack into separate rows automatically. Up to 4 rows visible; beyond that the effects band scrolls vertically. Row separators keep stacked pills readable.
- **Cursor-follow "+" affordance** — hover the effects band to see a "+" follow your cursor, click to open the Add Effect menu at that position. Right-click any empty spot or existing pill also opens a context menu.
- **Fade submenu on pills** — right-click a zoom or censor pill to pick a fade duration (None / 0.15 / 0.35 / 0.50 / 1.00 s). Applies to both fade-in and fade-out.

### Changed
- **Custom AVVideoCompositing** for zoom + censor rendering. Per-frame Core Image pipeline replaces `setTransformRamp` stepping — smooth motion, filter-based effects (blur/pixelate) alongside transform-based zoom, single render path shared by live preview, MP4 export (both AVAssetExportSession and quality-preset reencode), and GIF export.
- **Recording selection border color** now respects the current theme's accent color instead of hardcoded purple.
- **Recording color space** is now forced to sRGB at capture time (macOS 14+), fixing washed-out playback when recording on Display P3 screens.

### Fixed
- Blur and pixelate filters no longer wash out the untouched portions of the frame — compositor now uses a linear working color space and tags the output buffer with the source color space.

## [4.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Video export quality presets** — Low / Medium / High dropdown in the video editor. Non-High presets re-encode via a custom AVAssetReader → AVAssetWriter pipeline so the chosen bitrate is actually applied (AVAssetExportSession presets hardcode bitrate). Estimated output size in the editor factors in the chosen preset. Recording still writes at High so quality loss only happens at export time.
- **Timeline zoom segments in the video editor** — dedicated Zooms track below the trim timeline. Dashed "Click to zoom" placeholders fill every free gap in the row; clicking places a new 2x zoom segment at the cursor. Pills have visible resize handles (styled like the trim handles) and can be dragged or resized without overlapping.
- **Zoom segment settings popover** — click a selected pill to open a popover with a thumbnail preview, a 3×3 snap grid overlaid directly on the thumbnail for quick center selection, freeform drag for fine positioning, a zoom-level slider (1.2×–5×), and a Delete zoom button. Fades auto-scale so the plateau stays dominant on short segments.
- **Delete from floating thumbnail** — right-click menu on the post-capture thumbnail now includes a Delete option that removes the entry from screenshot history.

## [4.0.5-beta.22] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **Settings window redesign** — cleaner layout and stable Debug signing.

### Fixed
- **Mono theme selected-tool contrast** — the selected tool's icon is now readable against the Mono accent (was white-on-light-gray, now white-on-dark-gray).

## [4.0.5-beta.13] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Copy Screen Info** button in Settings > About — copies display and capture diagnostics to clipboard for bug reports.

### Fixed
- **Wrong colors on external monitors (third attempt)** — removed the 8-bit pixel format conversion (`copyTo8BitBGRA`) that was corrupting colors on some monitors. The raw CGImage from ScreenCaptureKit is now passed through directly and AppKit handles color management natively, matching how other screenshot tools (e.g. Shottr) work.
- **Editor cursor previews not showing** — loupe follow, pencil/marker circle, stamp preview, and other cursor overlays were broken in the editor window since beta 9. A window-snap cooldown flag was blocking `mouseMoved` events.

## [4.0.5-beta.11] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Wrong colors on external monitors (editor + saved files)** — captured screenshots are now normalized to sRGB at capture time instead of preserving the monitor's native ICC profile. Some external monitors (e.g. ViewSonic VX4380) have profiles that don't round-trip correctly through AppKit's rendering pipeline. Converting to sRGB immediately after ScreenCaptureKit returns the raw image ensures correct colors everywhere.
- **Last used tool not persisted across app restarts** — the selected annotation tool (pencil, arrow, etc.) now survives app restarts via UserDefaults.

## [4.0.5-beta.10] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Wrong colors on external monitors (editor + saved files)** — replaced all uses of `CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB()` (device-dependent, untagged) with either the source image's ICC profile or explicit sRGB. Fixes wildly shifted colors on displays with non-standard color profiles (e.g. ViewSonic VX4380, VG2448).

## [4.0.5-beta.9] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Capture Last Area** — new action that opens the overlay with the previous selection pre-applied. Available in the menu bar, as a configurable hotkey (Settings > Shortcuts), and via `macshot://capture-last` URL scheme.
- **URL scheme toggle** — "Enable macshot:// URL scheme" checkbox in Settings (enabled by default).

### Fixed
- **Instant overlay** — overlay now appears immediately (transparent) while screenshots capture in background. Eliminates all delay on hotkey press.
- **Window snap highlight race condition** — snap query deferred until screenshot arrives, preventing blue highlight artifacts on the transparent pre-screenshot overlay.
- **Permanent ScreenCaptureKit cache** — display enumeration cached for app lifetime, only refreshed on monitor connect/disconnect. First capture after launch is the only slow one.

### Changed
- **Removed "Remember last selection area" setting** — selection is now always saved. Use the new "Capture Last Area" action to re-capture the same region on demand.
- **Multi-select moved to Ctrl+click** — consistent with Ctrl+drag for lasso. Shift is now purely for angle/shape constraining.

## [4.0.5-beta.8] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Completely wrong colors on some external monitors** — displays with certain ICC profiles (e.g. ViewSonic 4K) caused the 8-bit pixel conversion to fail silently, passing through raw 16-bit GPU data with swapped Red/Blue channels. Now tries multiple pixel formats with automatic fallback.

## [4.0.5-beta.7] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Reverted capture pipeline to v4.0.4** — experimental performance changes introduced race conditions and rendering artifacts. Capture flow restored to the stable v4.0.4 implementation.

## [4.0.5-beta.5] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **DMG drag-to-install layout** — DMG now shows app icon + Applications folder with arrow background, matching the standard macOS install experience.
- **Move to Applications prompt** — when launched from a DMG or translocated path, offers to copy the app to /Applications with one click.
- **Duplicate instance alert** — shows a message instead of silently quitting when macshot is already running.

### Fixed
- **Saved screenshots have wrong colors on multi-monitor setups** — the save pipeline was converting Display P3 pixels to sRGB, shifting colors on mixed-colorspace setups (P3 built-in + sRGB external). Now embeds the native display color profile without altering pixel values. Removed the "Embed sRGB color profile" toggle — native profile is always embedded.
- **GIF export crash on longer recordings** — `CGImageDestinationFinalize` read freed pixel buffer memory (use-after-free) because `alwaysCopiesSampleData=false` allowed buffer recycling. Each frame's pixels are now copied into an owned context immediately.
- **GIF export freezes the UI** — switched from Swift concurrency `Task.detached` (cooperative thread pool shares threads with the main actor) to GCD `.background` queue (real kernel thread that macOS deprioritizes).
- **GIF export shows no progress** — "Processing GIF…" status now persists with a percentage indicator (0–50% during frame reading, then 100% after finalize).
- **Focus not returning to previous app** — `dismissOverlays` in `startCapture` was consuming `previousApp` before the new capture started, so focus couldn't be returned after the capture finished.
- **Text tool can't select other annotations** — clicking an arrow/rectangle while in text mode now selects it instead of requiring a tool switch.
- **Text annotation bounding box too wide** — width now shrinks to fit the actual text content on commit instead of keeping the original drag width. Fixed single-character minimum width.
- **Multi-select conflicts with Shift constraining** — multi-select moved from Shift+click to Ctrl+click, consistent with Ctrl+drag for lasso. Shift is now purely for angle/shape constraining.

### Changed
- **Faster first capture** — Core Animation/Metal pipeline pre-warmed at app launch. ScreenCaptureKit content cache no longer bypassed on every capture.

## [4.0.5-beta.3] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **URL scheme for external tools** — trigger macshot actions from Raycast, Alfred, BetterTouchTool, Shortcuts, or any automation tool via `macshot://capture`, `macshot://ocr`, `macshot://record`, and more. Run `open macshot://capture` from Terminal to test.

### Fixed
- **Color dithering in pinned images and editor window** — macOS's window compositor applies ordered dithering to layer content rendered via `draw()`, altering pixel values in solid-color areas (e.g. `#111D2F` becomes an alternating pattern of `#121D2F`, `#101D2E`, `#131D2D`). This was visible when re-capturing pinned screenshots or the editor window with the overlay. Fixed by disabling the `AutomaticAppKit` layer content format in favor of explicit `RGBA8`, ensuring pixel-perfect color reproduction.
- **Editor window color shift** — "Open in Editor Window" cropped the selection into a `CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB` context, converting Display P3 pixels to DeviceRGB and shifting colors. Now uses zero-copy `CGImage.cropping()` which preserves the original color space.
- **Slow first capture with window snapping** — every capture with floating thumbnails visible bypassed the ScreenCaptureKit content cache, causing a slow window server enumeration on each capture. Now uses the cache and only re-fetches if an excluded window isn't found.
- **Untranslated "None" in hotkey settings** — unassigned hotkey slots showed English "None" regardless of app language.
- **Minor translation fixes** — corrected missing diacritics in Catalan and Romanian translations.

## [4.0.4] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Customizable toolbar background color** — new "Background color" setting in Preferences > Appearance. All toolbar text, icons, borders, and system controls adapt to stay readable on any background.
- **Adaptive toolbar appearance** — toolbar and popovers automatically switch between light and dark AppKit appearance based on background brightness.
- **Export dimensions dropdown** — scale down recordings before saving (Original, 75%, 50%, 33%, 25%). Applied at export time; recordings always capture at full resolution.
- **Estimated export file size** — shows estimated output size in the video editor when trim, scale, or format change would affect the result.

### Fixed
- **Multi-line text clipped after commit** — text snapshot now uses the same measurement as the rendering engine, preventing the last line from being cut off at non-default font sizes.
- **Ctrl+lasso broken in pencil mode** — Ctrl now enables instant annotation selection in pencil mode (no long-press delay). Multi-selections can be dragged without holding Ctrl, matching all other tools.
- **Pen pressure over-smoothing after many strokes** — committed annotations are now drawn from a cached bitmap during active drawing, preventing progressive frame time degradation that caused macOS to coalesce tablet events and reduce stroke fidelity.
- **Pen pressure range** — light touch now gives 20–100% of stroke width (was 30–100%) for finer control.
- **Apple Translation language list empty on first use** — the Translation framework can return stale results at launch; empty results are no longer cached, so the language picker retries on next open.
- **Global hotkeys stop working after closing editor** — `NSApp.hide(nil)` could suspend the Carbon event loop; replaced with cooperative focus transfer.
- **Window snap highlight not showing on overlay appear** — snap query now runs immediately at the mouse position instead of waiting for mouse movement. (PR #100, thanks @TimFang4162)
- **Smoother refined pencil stroke tails** — end of refined strokes no longer has an abrupt straight segment.
- **Cursor flicker after finishing a stroke** — the annotation cache is now incrementally updated on commit instead of rebuilt from scratch.
- **Video editor bottom bar overlap** — left-side info gracefully hides when the window is narrow instead of overlapping action buttons.
- **Timeline thumbnail seams** — sub-pixel gaps between thumbnail tiles eliminated.

### Changed
- **Lasso selection moved to Ctrl+drag** — frees Shift for line/shape constraining without timing conflicts.
- **Video editor minimum width** increased to 820px to ensure all controls fit.

## [4.0.3] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Text formatting on selected annotations** — font size, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font family, alignment, background, and outline controls now work on selected text annotations without entering edit mode.

### Fixed
- **Pen pressure sensitivity** — light touch now gives 30%–100% of stroke width (was 0%–100%), power curve reduces drastic variation, pressure smoothing no longer over-averages, and cursor preview dot no longer flickers with pressure changes.
- **Drawing color resets to red** — color and opacity now persist across captures and app launches.
- **Text shifts left and reflows on commit** — NSTextView's default `lineFragmentPadding` was making editing width narrower than the snapshot, causing position shift and word reflow.
- **Multi-line text clipped after commit** — scrollView frame wasn't resized to fit content before snapshotting.
- **Toolbar color swatch not updating** — color changes from any source (eyedropper, picker, color wheel) now immediately update the toolbar preview.
- **Toolbar doesn't reflect selected text formatting** — selecting a text annotation now loads its actual font size, bold, italic, etc. into the toolbar controls.
- **Annotation resize lag** — expensive CIFilter outline glow was regenerating every frame during resize. Now draws a simple stroke rect during resize.
- **Upload history layout** — rows now stretch to full width in Settings.
- **Annotation control button styles** — edit (pencil) and rotation buttons now match the delete button style: dark fill, accent border, bold white icon.
- **Recording HUD disappears when closing old video editor** — app no longer hides while recording is active.
- **Rotation handle icon off-center** — switched to symmetric symbol with sub-pixel alignment correction.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Pen pressure sensitivity** — Apple Pencil (Sidecar) and tablet pressure varies stroke width in real time. Toggle via "Pressure" checkbox in pencil tool options. Pressure data is preserved through smoothing and in editable history. Non-tablet users are unaffected.
- **Paste screenshot as file in Finder** — Cmd+V in Finder now pastes the captured screenshot as a PNG file.

### Changed
- **Recording always produces MP4** — format picker removed from recording settings. GIF export is now a post-recording option in the video editor via an MP4/GIF toggle, so you can decide the format after seeing what you captured.
- **Video editor uses custom accent color** — trim handles, play button, and other controls now respect the user's custom accent color instead of hardcoded purple.

### Fixed
- **Annotation drawing performance** — overlay was redrawing every annotation from scratch on every frame (even for cursor movement). Committed annotations are now cached into a single bitmap, making drawing with many annotations smooth.
- **Dragging/resizing/rotating annotations with many drawings** — during manipulation, only the affected annotation redraws live; all others use a cached image.
- **Rotation lag on annotations** — the selection outline glow was regenerating an expensive CIFilter pipeline on every frame during rotation. Now cached at rotation=0 and rotated via GPU transform at draw time.
- **Zoom lag with annotations** — pinch-zooming caused all annotations to re-render every frame because NSImage's drawing handler was re-invoked at each new scale. Replaced with a fixed bitmap that blits without re-rendering.
- **Selection outline clipping on rotated shapes** — the glow bitmap was sized to the unrotated bounding box, clipping rotated shapes. Now expands to the rotated bounding box.
- **Selection outline not following rotation** — outline glow cache wasn't invalidated on rotation change, showing a stale unrotated outline.
- **Annotation color shift after drawing** — cached annotation layer used deviceRGB instead of the display's color space (Display P3), causing a subtle color change when annotations moved to the cache. Now uses the window's screen color space.
- **Zoom coordinate misalignment** — zooming back to 1x via trackpad left residual floating-point anchor values, causing background and annotation layers to drift apart. Anchors now reset to zero at 1x.
- **Window snap state not synced across monitors** — pressing Tab to toggle window snapping only updated the helper text on the active monitor. Now syncs across all screens.
- **Crash on macOS 26 (Tahoe) when using beautify** — `BeautifyRenderer` actor isolation violated under macOS 26's stricter concurrency enforcement. Fixed `@MainActor` scope.
- **Crash with negative beautify style index** — modulo operator produced negative index with custom background images. Fixed to always produce a valid index.
- **Beautify custom background lag** — custom background images were re-decoded and re-processed (including CIFilter blur) on every draw frame. Now pre-rendered to a cached CGImage.
- **Dock icon click opens Settings over video editor** — now only opens Settings when no windows are visible.
- **Recording HUD disappears when closing old video editor** — closing a previous video editor window while recording would hide the app and kill the recording UI. Now skips focus return while recording is active.
- **Missing translations** — 8 UI strings added across all 40 locales.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Crash on macOS 26 (Tahoe) when using beautify with mesh gradient styles** — SwiftUI `ImageRenderer` was called from inside an `NSImage` drawing handler closure, violating `@MainActor` isolation under macOS 26's stricter concurrency enforcement. Mesh gradients are now pre-rendered before entering the drawing handler.
- **Menu bar icon not centered** — SVG viewBox was non-square (658×570) with misaligned origin, causing the icon to render off-center. Fixed to a properly centered square viewBox. Added `preserves-vector-representation` for crisp rendering.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Screen recording** — record MP4 or GIF with configurable FPS (up to 120fps), system audio + microphone capture, annotation drawing during recording, and mouse click highlighting. Pause/resume support with gap-free output. Audio merge dialog for dual-source recordings.
- **Webcam overlay** — live camera feed bubble during recordings. Circle or rounded rectangle shape, four corner positions, three sizes. Camera device picker via right-click.
- **Keystroke overlay** — show pressed keys on-screen during recording. "Shortcuts Only" vs "All Keystrokes" modes.
- **Recording countdown** — configurable delay timer before recording starts.
- **Video editor** — standalone window for trimming, exporting, and uploading recorded videos. Timeline thumbnail strip, arrow key frame stepping, Copy button.
- **Editable annotation history** — screenshots save raw image + annotation data alongside the composited image. Editing from history reopens with live, editable annotations. "Done" button commits changes back to the same history entry.
- **Lasso marquee selection** — hold Shift and drag on empty space from any tool (including pencil/marker) to select multiple annotations at once.
- **Shift+Click multi-selection** — hold Shift and click annotations to toggle them in/out of the selection. Drag moves all selected, Delete removes all selected, color changes apply to all.
- **Annotation copy/paste (Cmd+C/V)** — copy selected annotations and paste as duplicates. Works with multi-selection.
- **Annotation outlines** — outline toggle + color picker for arrows, lines, rectangles, ellipses, and number tools.
- **Custom beautify backgrounds** — use any image as the beautify background with optional blur slider. 6 new gradient styles.
- **Apple Translation (on-device)** — translate on-device using Apple's Translation framework on macOS 15+. Faster, offline, and private. Auto-detects source language.
- **Smart marker mode** — OCR-based text detection snaps the marker to actual text lines. Vertical pill cursor with dynamic sizing.
- **WYSIWYG drawing cursor** — pencil and marker tools show a live dot preview matching exact stroke size and color.
- **"Open from Clipboard" hotkey** — configurable global hotkey to open clipboard image in editor.
- **"Also open in Editor" option** — quick capture performs the action AND opens the editor.
- **"Do nothing" Quick Capture mode** — capture without copying or saving; decide later via thumbnail.
- **Customizable overlay/editor tool shortcuts** — all tool shortcuts configurable in Settings.
- **Pencil smoothing modes** — 3-mode selector: None, Smooth (Chaikin), Refined (moving average + Chaikin with zero input lag).
- **Beta update channel** — opt-in pre-release builds via Sparkle.
- **WebP image opening** — open .webp files for editing via menu, Finder, or drag-to-dock.

### Changed
- **Text tool uses standard annotation chrome** — text annotations show the same selection UI as shapes (resize handles, rotate, delete). Double-click to re-enter editing.
- **Unified Censor tool** — Pixelate, Blur, Solid, and Erase modes merged into a single toolbar button. Erase mode samples surrounding colors for seamless fills.
- **Click-to-select annotations** — click any annotation with any tool to select it and edit properties in real time. Pencil/marker use long-press to avoid interfering with drawing.
- **Recent Captures panel** — horizontal scrolling thumbnails with filter tabs, right-click context menu, drag-and-drop.
- **Pixelate annotations** — now movable, resizable, and reorderable. Re-bakes from original screenshot.
- **sRGB color profile** — proper pixel value conversion for accurate colors matching native macOS screenshots.
- **Renamed Preferences to Settings** — all user-facing references updated.

### Fixed
- **Blurry screenshots on mixed-DPI setups** — direct CGImage extraction preserves exact pixel data regardless of display.
- **Pre-macOS 14 capture corruption** — uses `CGWindowListCreateImage` on macOS 12–13 instead of raw memcpy.
- **Capture delay on macOS Tahoe** — pre-warm SCShareableContent cache, reducing 2-second delay to near-instant.
- **Focus returns to previous app after capture** — overlay dismiss re-activates the previously focused application.
- **Purple selection border no longer appears in recordings** — UI chrome excluded from SCStream capture.
- **Recording pause/resume produces gap-free video** — paused time subtracted from timestamps.
- **Light mode toolbar readability** — toolbar and popovers force dark appearance for consistent contrast.
- **Scroll capture reliability** — complete engine rewrite with CPU-backed frame comparison, Vision-based offset detection, and incremental stitching.
- **Multi-select drag works in text tool mode** — text tool no longer blocks dragging multi-selected annotations.
- **Pencil/marker shift-constrain** — straightening now anchors from where Shift was pressed, not the stroke origin.

## [4.0.0-beta.06] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Focus returns to previous app after capture** — closing the overlay (Escape, Enter, Cmd+C, etc.) now re-activates the previously focused application. No more click-to-refocus.
- **Annotations preserved in beautified window snaps** — beautify + window snap captures now include annotations. Previously, annotations were lost because the beautify input used the raw window image without them.

## [4.0.0-beta.05] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Cmd+Q and Escape now trigger unsaved changes warning** — previously bypassed the save dialog and closed the editor without warning.
- **Lasso selection disabled for pencil/marker** — Shift+drag in pencil and marker tools now constrains to straight lines as expected, instead of triggering the lasso marquee selection.
- **Recording HUD spacing** — reduced excess padding on the right side of the timer for balanced layout.

### Translations
- **17 new strings translated** across 40 languages: save dialog (Save & Close, Discard), recording controls (Stop/Pause/Resume), translation engine settings, webcam labels.

## [4.0.0-beta.04] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Auto-save to history on every editor output** — Copy, Save, Pin, Upload, and Share from the editor now automatically persist the current image and annotations to screenshot history. A history entry is created on first output if none exists.
- **Unsaved changes warning on editor close** — closing the editor with unsaved changes shows a "Save & Close / Discard / Cancel" dialog. Warns for captures that were never saved (the image would be lost), and for history entries with annotation changes since last save.

### Fixed
- **Refined pencil stroke endpoint** — strokes now end exactly where the user released the mouse instead of stopping short due to the smoothing algorithm pulling the endpoint inward.

## [4.0.0-beta.03] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Custom background image for beautify** — click the "+" button in the gradient picker to choose any image as the beautify background. Image stored persistently, shown as a selectable thumbnail swatch. Aspect-fill rendering with center crop.
- **Background blur slider** — when a custom background image is active, a Blur slider appears in the beautify options row. Applies CIGaussianBlur (0–50px) to the background image.
- **6 new gradient styles** — Emerald, Cherry, Sapphire, Sand, Pure White, Pure Black.
- **Annotation copy/paste (Cmd+C/V)** — copy selected annotations and paste them as duplicates. Works with text, shapes, and multi-selection. Text annotations: Cmd+C with no text selected copies the whole text box.
- **Zero-lag Refined pencil mode** — Refined smoothing now draws raw points instantly during the stroke, applying the moving average + Chaikin smoothing retroactively on mouse up. Same visual result, zero input lag.

### Changed
- **Text tool uses standard annotation chrome** — committed text annotations now show the same purple selection UI as all other shapes (resize handles, rotate, delete, edit button). Handles actually resize the text box. Double-click to re-enter editing. Removed custom dashed border and move handle.
- **Renamed Preferences to Settings** — menu item, window title, and all user-facing references updated.

### Fixed
- **Editor OCR ignoring preference** — OCR button in editor now respects the "Copy to clipboard only" setting. OCR window Copy button no longer fails to close (controller retained properly).
- **Color wheel checkmark visibility** — checkmark now uses dark stroke on light swatches (white, yellow) for contrast.

### Translations
- **26 new strings translated** across all 40 languages: Settings, Also open in Editor, Hide controls, Pixelate, Blur, Solid, Erase, Done, Do nothing, overlay shortcuts, audio merge dialog, and more.

## [4.0.0-beta.02] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Lasso marquee selection** — hold Shift and drag on empty space from any tool to draw a selection rectangle. All annotations intersecting the marquee are selected on release. Blue dashed border with translucent fill while dragging.
- **"Open from Clipboard" hotkey** — new configurable global hotkey in Preferences > Shortcuts (default: None). Opens the clipboard image in the editor from anywhere.

### Changed
- **Select tool removed from shortcuts** — annotation selection is now handled entirely via click-to-select, Shift+click multi-select, and Shift+drag lasso from any tool. No dedicated tool needed.

### Fixed
- **Blurry screenshots on mixed-DPI setups** — replaced `tiffRepresentation` with direct CGImage extraction in the image encoder. Preserves exact pixel data regardless of which display the app runs on. Fixes quality loss when Retina and non-Retina monitors are mixed.
- **Purple selection border in recordings** — the selection border overlay now draws entirely outside the capture rect, and macshot's UI chrome windows (border + HUD) are excluded from SCStream capture.

## [4.0.0-beta.01] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Hide recording controls** — new option in Preferences > Recording and the gear menu to hide the floating HUD and selection border during recording. Stop via menu bar icon.

### Changed
- **Shortcut preferences UI** — unified all buttons to "Set", added reset-to-default (↺) button on every shortcut row for both global hotkeys and overlay/editor tool shortcuts.

### Fixed
- **Shortcut "Set" button stuck on "Press..."** — button title now resets after recording completes or is cancelled.
- **Toolbar text labels off-center** — font name, "Fill", and "Outline" labels in the options row were 1-2px low due to AppKit's recessed button padding. Fixed with baseline offset.

## [3.8.0-beta.10] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **"Also open in Editor" now shows Done button** — editor opened via quick capture receives the history entry ID, so the Done button appears and edits commit back to history.
- **Enter in editor adds to history** — pressing Enter in an editor that wasn't opened from history (e.g. "Open in Editor", "Open Image...") now creates a history entry and shows the Done button for future edits.

## [3.8.0-beta.9] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Customizable overlay/editor tool shortcuts** — tool shortcuts (P=Pencil, R=Rectangle, etc.) are now configurable in Preferences > Shortcuts. Each tool can be assigned a single key or set to None. Added Ellipse shortcut (O) by default.
- **Audio merge dialog** — when recording with both system audio and microphone, a dialog appears after recording with volume sliders for each source. "Merge Audio" combines both into a single track for universal player compatibility; "Keep Separate" preserves the original two-track file.
- **"Also open in Editor" option** — new checkbox in Preferences > General > Capture. When enabled, quick capture (Enter, hotkey, scroll capture) performs the save/copy action AND opens the editor with the image and annotations.

### Changed
- **Recording audio quality** — audio bitrate increased to 256kbps AAC with explicit stereo channel layout for better quality and broader player compatibility.
- **Recording video metadata** — BT.709 color primaries, transfer function, and YCbCr matrix are now embedded in the video track for correct color rendering across all players.
- **Recording audio sync** — audio samples arriving before the first video frame are buffered and flushed when the session starts, preventing gaps at the beginning of recordings. Single serial queue for all recording I/O eliminates data races.
- **Mic audio track priority** — when both system audio and mic are recorded, the mic track is written first so players that only decode the first audio track get the mic content.

### Fixed
- **Recording HUD disappearing** — the recording control bar and selection border sometimes vanished when starting a recording. Caused by `NSApp.hide()` racing with panel creation; replaced with `NSApp.deactivate()`.

## [3.8.0-beta.8] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Editable annotation history** — screenshots with annotations now save the raw image and annotation data alongside the composited image. Editing from the thumbnail or history panel reopens with live, editable annotations instead of a flattened image.
- **"Done" button in editor** — when editing a history entry, a Done button appears in the top bar. Clicking it commits the current annotations back to the same history entry in-place. Closing without Done discards changes.

### Changed
- **Editor scroll view layout** — scroll view is now properly inset from the top bar, fixing the scrollbar hiding behind it. Window sizing accounts for all toolbar chrome so images open without overlap.
- **Editor centering with insets** — the CenteringClipView now accounts for content insets when centering the document, fixing the inability to scroll past the bottom toolbar at 100% zoom.

### Fixed
- **Enter key in editor ignoring Quick Capture mode** — pressing Enter in the editor always saved to file regardless of the "Enter / Quick Capture" preference. Now correctly respects Save / Copy / Save+Copy / Do nothing modes, matching overlay behavior.

## [3.8.0-beta.7] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Apple Translation crash on rapid toggle** — concurrent translation sessions caused an assertion failure inside Apple's Translation framework. New translations now cancel any in-flight request first, and stale sessions are ignored.
- **Translate button stays toggled after undo** — Cmd+Z now correctly untoggles the translate button when undoing translation overlays.

## [3.8.0-beta.6] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **"Do nothing" Quick Capture mode** — new option in the Enter/Quick Capture dropdown. Capture is taken and the floating thumbnail appears, but nothing is copied or saved. Decide later via thumbnail buttons (copy, save, edit, pin, upload).
- **Keyboard shortcuts in menu bar** — menu items now display their configured hotkey (e.g. ⇧⌘X) inline, matching standard macOS behavior. Updates live when changed in Preferences.
- **Shift+Click instant selection in pencil/marker tools** — hold Shift to immediately select annotations without the 300ms long-press delay. Supports multi-selection toggle, same as shape tools. Without Shift, the long-press behavior is preserved.
- **Async clipboard & history** — PNG encoding for clipboard moved to background thread. Screenshot history thumbnails and index saving run off main thread.
- **SF Symbol icon cache** — toolbar icons are cached across rebuilds, eliminating re-rasterization on every capture cycle.
- **Unlimited history option** — new checkbox in Preferences to disable history size limit.
- **Thumbnail scale slider** — configurable floating thumbnail size in Preferences (default 240×160).

### Changed
- **Translate language picker** — non-installed languages are now filtered out entirely instead of shown dimmed. Cleaner list when using Apple Translation.
- **Narrow selection layout** — right toolbar moves below the selection instead of overlapping when the selection is too narrow.

### Fixed
- **Thumbnail captured in screenshots** — floating thumbnails are now excluded via ScreenCaptureKit's `excludingWindows` filter, eliminating race conditions during rapid captures.
- **Recording pause/resume gap** — paused time is now subtracted from frame and audio timestamps, producing gap-free video with synced audio instead of black frames.
- **Light mode toolbar readability** — toolbar options row and all popovers now force dark appearance, fixing unreadable text (segment controls, labels, buttons, list pickers) when the system is in light mode.
- **Apple Translation "not installed" for English** — language availability check no longer fails on same-language pairs (e.g. en→en). Each language is checked against all others; results are cached for instant popover reopening.
- **Shift+Click deselect while dragging** — shift-clicking an already-selected annotation now defers deselect to mouseUp, so multi-selection drag works correctly across all tools.

## [3.8.0-beta.5] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Apple Translation (on-device)** — new translation engine option in Preferences for macOS 15.0+. Translates on-device using Apple's Translation framework — faster, offline, and private. Auto-detects source language via NLLanguageRecognizer. Falls back to a clear error (never silently sends text to Google) if language detection fails or language pack is missing.
- **Translation provider picker** — dropdown in Preferences General tab to choose between Apple (on-device) and Google Translate. Includes a link to download language packs in System Settings.
- **Language availability in translate popover** — when Apple Translation is selected, the language picker shows which language packs are installed. Non-installed languages are dimmed with "not installed" label and can't be selected.

## [3.8.0-beta.4] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Annotation outlines** — new outline toggle + color picker for arrows (all styles including thick), lines, rectangles, ellipses, and number tools. Outline draws as a contrasting border around the shape, visible on any background. Persisted per-annotation and in global settings.
- **Shift+Click multi-selection** — hold Shift and click annotations to add them to the selection. Drag moves all selected, Delete removes all selected, color changes apply to all. Full controls (resize, rotate) shown for single selection; glow highlight for multi-select.
- **Scroll Capture keyboard shortcut** — new configurable hotkey slot in Preferences > Shortcuts.

### Changed
- **Color wheel selection** — now purely angle-based. Moving the mouse far from the wheel still selects the color at that angle instead of deselecting.
- **sRGB color profile** — fixed color space conversion. Screenshots with "Embed sRGB profile" enabled now have accurate colors matching the native macOS screenshot tool (proper pixel value conversion instead of re-tagging).

### Fixed
- **Hotkey display for non-standard keys** — unknown keyCodes now use UCKeyTranslate to show the actual character instead of "?". Helps with non-Apple keyboards and BTT remapped keys.

## [3.8.0-beta.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **WYSIWYG drawing cursor** — pencil and marker tools now show a live dot preview matching the exact stroke size and color instead of a pen icon cursor. System cursor is hidden; the dot IS the cursor.
- **Smart marker live text preview** — in smart marker mode, the cursor pill dynamically scales to match the detected text line height as you hover. OCR runs eagerly on first hover for instant feedback.
- **Recording pause/resume** — new pause button in the recording control bar. Paused frames and audio are dropped; timer pauses. Red dot turns orange when paused.
- **Recording control bar redesign** — floating HUD replaced with a full control bar: stop button, pause/resume toggle, timer with recording indicator, and a draggable handle. Dark themed with rounded corners.
- **Scroll Capture keyboard shortcut** — new configurable hotkey slot in Preferences > Shortcuts (no default assigned).

### Changed
- **Smart marker vertical alignment** — highlight now centers on the text body (x-height) instead of the geometric center of the bounding box, compensating for descender space.
- **Smart marker drag size** — stroke uses detected text line height from the start of the drag, not just on release. No more size jump when finishing the stroke.
- **Recording mode cancel** — pressing Escape or the X button in recording setup now dismisses the overlay entirely instead of falling back to screenshot mode.

### Fixed
- **Cursor preview ghosting at zoom** — dirty rect invalidation now scales by zoom level, preventing ghost artifacts from previous cursor positions when zoomed in.
- **Drawing cursor visible during annotation drag** — dot preview now hides when dragging, resizing, or rotating an annotation.
- **Pan while drawing with Apple Pencil** — trackpad scroll events suppressed during active drawing to prevent simultaneous pan and draw on Sidecar.
- **Recording HUD drag drift** — switched from delta-based to absolute positioning using screen coordinates. HUD stays exactly under cursor during drag with zero drift.
- **Recording HUD flicker** — fixed width prevents frame resize on timer tick; auto-repositioning stops once user drags the HUD.
- **Hotkey display for non-standard keys** — unknown keyCodes now use UCKeyTranslate to show the actual character instead of "?". Helps with non-Apple keyboards and BTT remapped keys.
- **Sparkle beta update detection** — switched from version-string comparison to monotonic build numbers (CI run number) for `sparkle:version`, ensuring beta-to-beta updates are always detected.

## [3.8.0-beta.2] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Webcam overlay** — toggle in recording toolbar to show a live camera feed bubble during screen recordings. Supports circle and rounded rectangle shapes, four corner positions, three sizes (small/medium/large). Right-click the webcam button to select a camera device. Settings available in both the recording settings popover and Preferences Recording tab. Camera session is reused when starting recording to avoid startup flash.
- **Webcam localization** — webcam overlay strings translated in all 40 languages.
- **Beta updates localization** — "Check for beta updates" translated in all 40 languages.

### Fixed
- **Recording "Stop Sharing" button** — clicking macOS's "Stop Sharing" in the screen recording indicator now gracefully stops the recording instead of leaving a zombie state. Implemented `SCStreamDelegate.stream(_:didStopWithError:)`.
- **Color wheel toolbar sync** — selecting a color via right-click color wheel now updates the toolbar color swatch immediately.
- **Google Drive error messages** — folder search, folder creation, and file upload now surface Google's actual API error message and HTTP status code instead of generic "failed" strings.
- **Recording permission dialog overlap** — when multiple permissions (mic + camera) need prompting on first use, dialogs now appear sequentially instead of overlapping behind the overlay.
- **Mouse highlight performance** — replaced runaway draw loop (9% CPU in profiler) with a 30fps timer that auto-stops when idle. Reusable NSBezierPath eliminates per-frame allocations.
- **Webcam preview follows selection move** — moving the recording area via the move tool now repositions the webcam preview to match.

## [3.8.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Beta update channel** — new "Check for beta updates" toggle in Preferences. When enabled, Sparkle will offer pre-release builds alongside stable releases. Beta builds are signed and notarized identically to stable releases.
- **GIF processing toast** — "Processing GIF..." toast during encoding, encoding moved off main thread to prevent beach ball.
- **Mic device picker** — right-click the mic button during recording setup to select input device. Shows live volume level inside the button. Filters out virtual aggregate devices. Pre-checks microphone permission on recording mode entry.
- **Keystroke overlay** — toggle in recording toolbar to show pressed keys on-screen during recording. Right-click for "Shortcuts Only" vs "All Keystrokes" mode. Pill-shaped HUD at bottom center with fade animation.
- **Recording countdown** — delay timer fires after pressing record, with countdown centered on the recording area. Per-session delay override in recording settings popover.
- **Video editor improvements** — timeline thumbnail strip from video frames, arrow key frame stepping, Copy button (copies video/GIF to clipboard) with dropdown for Copy Path.
- **Pencil smoothing modes** — 3-mode selector: None (raw points), Smooth (Chaikin on finish), Refined (moving-average window while drawing + Chaikin on finish). Replaces the previous on/off toggle.
- **Pencil/marker single-click dot** — single click now produces a visible filled circle at stroke width instead of nothing.
- **Anchor points on unselected lines** — right-click to add bend anchor points to lines and arrows without selecting them first.

### Changed
- **Pencil/marker selection** — replaced click-to-select with long-press (300ms) to select annotations, so taps and drags always draw. Fixes Apple Pencil/Sidecar issue where taps were intercepted as selection.
- **Pixelate annotations** — now movable, resizable, and reorderable. Re-bakes from the original screenshot instead of composited image. Censor annotations render first so other annotations always appear on top.
- **Recording mode input** — all keyboard shortcuts blocked during recording setup except Escape. Arrow cursor shown instead of crosshair. Focus returns to previously active app when recording starts.

### Fixed
- **Scroll capture hover corruption** — mouse hover events suppressed via CGEvent tap during scroll capture to prevent hover effects from corrupting stitch detection.
- **Scroll capture sticky headers** — strip-only merge appends only new rows per frame, preventing sticky headers from duplicating. Single-sample header detection for immediate activation. Vision crop capped at 20% to prevent over-cropping on dark backgrounds.
- **MP4 recording cleanup** — recording UI (HUD, border, menu bar) now properly cleaned up on MP4 recording completion.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **40 languages** - full UI localization with language switcher in Preferences. Supported: Arabic, Bengali, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese. Auto-detects system language, switchable at runtime.

### Fixed
- **History panel blocks all input** - the backdrop window could get stuck capturing all clicks when the app lost focus (e.g. using Cmd+Shift+4 or a Sparkle update dialog appearing). The backdrop now auto-dismisses when the app deactivates, supports Escape key directly, and is torn down immediately on dismiss instead of waiting for the animation to complete.

## [3.6.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **History panel blocks all input** - the backdrop window could get stuck capturing all clicks when the app lost focus (e.g. using Cmd+Shift+4 or a Sparkle update dialog appearing). The backdrop now auto-dismisses when the app deactivates, supports Escape key directly, and is torn down immediately on dismiss instead of waiting for the animation to complete.
- **Share button not working** - share picker panel was hidden behind the overlay window.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Unified Censor tool** — Pixelate, Blur, Solid, and Erase modes merged into a single toolbar button with mode selector. Erase mode intelligently samples surrounding border colors and fills with seamless edge-interpolated gradients, making erased content invisible on solid and gradient backgrounds.
- **Click-to-select annotations** — click any annotation with any tool to select it, view its properties, and edit stroke width, line style, arrow style, fill style, and corner radius in real time. Full undo/redo support. No more dedicated "Select & Edit" button needed.
- **Recent Captures panel** — new drop-down panel slides from the top of the screen. Horizontal scrolling thumbnails with filter tabs (All / Screenshots / GIFs), right-click context menu (Copy, Save As, Open in Editor, Pin to Screen, Quick Look, Delete), drag-and-drop images to other apps.
- **OCR Capture action** — new dropdown in Preferences: "Show window + copy to clipboard", "Show window only", or "Copy to clipboard only".
- **Automatic update toggle** — "Check for updates automatically" checkbox in Preferences for Homebrew users who manage updates externally.
- **Custom censor toolbar icon** — checkerboard icon replaces the generic grid, clearly communicating pixelate/censor functionality.
- **Annotation resize cursors** — directional resize cursors on shape handles (diagonal for corners, horizontal/vertical for edges), open/closed hand for drag.
- **Highlighter icon** — uses the native `highlighter` SF Symbol on macOS 14+ (falls back to paintbrush on older versions).

### Changed
- **Annotation selection model** — replaced automatic hover-to-move with explicit click-to-select. Click an annotation to select it, Escape or click empty space to deselect. Selected annotations stay selected after drag, resize, and rotation.
- **Pencil/marker selection highlight** — traces the actual stroke path with a smooth glow instead of a bounding rectangle. Uses transparency layer to prevent alpha compounding at self-intersections.
- **Dashed/dotted patterns** — symmetrical distribution on rectangles and ellipses via fitted dash patterns with phase offset. Sharp-cornered dashed rectangles drawn per-side with corner inset to avoid overlap artifacts.
- **PII auto-detect button** — split button with dropdown arrow for type selection, replacing the separate "Types" button.
- **Max stroke width** — increased from 20px to 30px for all tools.
- **History panel animation** — slide-down/up speed doubled (0.25s → 0.12s).
- **Beautify label** — "Pad" renamed to "Padding" in options row.
- **Censor options layout** — all buttons use uniform height and font size for visual consistency.
- **Beautify gradient swatch** — updates live when selecting a new gradient from the picker popover.

### Fixed
- **Pre-macOS 14 capture corruption** — replaced the SCStream single-frame capture (which used a raw memcpy assuming BGRA 8-bit pixel format) with `CGWindowListCreateImage` on macOS 12–13. Fixes garbled/corrupted screenshots on Intel Macs and non-standard pixel formats. (#48, #53)
- **Capture delay on macOS Tahoe** — pre-warm `SCShareableContent` cache on hotkey press and menu bar click, switch to `onScreenWindowsOnly: true` to skip hidden window enumeration. Reduces 2-second capture delay to near-instant on systems with many background processes. (#31)
- **Editor click dead zones** — toolbar strips in the editor used container-space coordinates for hit testing against editor-space points, creating horizontal dead zones where drawing tools wouldn't respond. Fixed by skipping cross-coordinate-space checks in editor mode.
- **Editor toolbar pass-through** — toolbar strip and options row gaps now pass through mouse events in editor mode so drawing works even when the image is behind the toolbar area.
- **Thick arrow hit detection** — hit zone was ~2x wider than the drawn shape (27.5px vs 7.5px shaft). Now matches the actual shaft width plus 4px tolerance.
- **Blur + text-only mode** — was producing pixelated output instead of blur. AutoRedactor now reads censorMode from UserDefaults before baking annotations.
- **Measure tool behind beautify** — in-progress annotations (measure lines, etc.) are now re-drawn on top of the beautify preview.
- **Annotation deselect on resize** — resizing/rotating an annotation's handles no longer deselects it when using non-select tools.
- **History panel drag-and-drop** — panel and backdrop windows now hide when drag starts so target apps (Telegram, Slack, etc.) can receive the drop. Uses NSURL pasteboard writer for proper file type support.
- **ListPickerView width** — popover width computed from content instead of hardcoded 160px.

## [3.5.3] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **18 new mesh gradient styles** — replaced the previous 7 mesh gradients with 18 new high-contrast styles featuring displaced grid points and bolder color combinations. Added "Charcoal" linear gradient style.
- **Scroll capture live stitching** — frames are now captured and stitched continuously during manual scrolling, not just after the scroll gesture ends. Preview updates in real time as you scroll.

### Changed
- **Scroll capture engine rewrite** — completely rewritten for reliability. Uses on-demand frame capture (`CGWindowListCreateImage`) instead of persistent streams, TIFF byte-by-byte comparison for pixel-perfect frame settlement, Vision-based offset detection, and incremental stitching. Handles Chrome smooth scrolling, lazy-loaded content, and scrollbar interference. Max scroll height increased from 20,000 to 30,000 pixels.
- **Beautify shadow slider range** — increased maximum from 40 to 100 for more dramatic shadow effects.
- **Hotkey modal dismiss** — pressing the capture hotkey while a modal dialog is open (e.g. Preferences, permission prompts) now dismisses the modal and triggers the capture, instead of being silently ignored.
- **Status bar menu reliability** — clicking the menu bar icon while a modal is open now properly dismisses the modal before showing the menu.

### Fixed
- **Function key hotkeys** — F1–F20 can now be used as capture hotkeys without requiring modifier keys (Cmd/Shift/Option/Ctrl). Fixes support for non-Mac keyboards with dedicated function keys.

## [3.5.2] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Smart marker mode** — OCR-based text detection snaps the marker's vertical position and height to actual text lines. Respects the user's horizontal drag range while auto-aligning to the nearest text. Toggle in marker tool options. Vertical pill cursor when active.
- **Scroll capture live preview panel** — floating panel beside the capture region shows the stitched image updating in real-time as you scroll. Bottom-aligned with the selection rectangle, grows upward.
- **Editor zoom dropdown** — the zoom percentage in the editor top bar is now a clickable dropdown with Zoom In/Out, Fit Canvas, and preset levels (50%/100%/200%). Replaces the old reset-zoom button.
- **Editor keyboard zoom** — `Cmd+=`/`Cmd+-` to zoom in/out, `Cmd+0` for 100%, `Cmd+1` for fit canvas in the editor window.
- **Arrow flip toggle** — new "Flip" button in arrow tool options to reverse the arrowhead direction (head at start instead of end).
- **Toolbar color customization** — accent and icon colors are now configurable in Preferences with live preview and reset-to-default.
- **GIF recordings in history** — GIF recordings now appear in the screenshot history with a thumbnail from the first frame.
- **Homebrew Cask CI** — release workflow auto-bumps the Homebrew cask formula via `brew bump-cask-pr`.

### Changed
- **Scroll capture frame stability** — fixed a critical bug where the frame stability check was non-functional: it compared GPU-backed frames whose pixel data was inaccessible, so the comparison always failed silently. Every capture was essentially grabbing whatever frame happened to be available, including mid-scroll and mid-render states. Now properly converts frames to CPU-backed memory before comparing, with exponential backoff (10ms–80ms) for apps with slow compositors like Chrome.
- **Scroll capture speed** — persistent capture stream runs at 120fps (was 60fps) for fresher frames. Auto-scroll cycle reduced from ~200ms to ~80ms per frame. Manual scroll settlement tuned for reliable captures without unnecessary delays.
- **Annotation selection highlight** — replaced the dashed rectangle with semi-transparent fill with a clean accent-colored outline that follows the annotation's actual shape (rounded rect corners, ellipse outline, etc.). Resize handles now use white fill with accent border.
- **Rotation snap** — holding Shift while rotating now snaps to 45-degree steps instead of 90-degree.
- **Rotation hit-testing** — hit-test for rotated annotations now properly un-rotates the test point, fixing cases where clicking on a rotated shape wouldn't select it.
- **Pencil cursor** — larger (25% bigger) with black outline for better visibility on light backgrounds.
- **Thick arrow sizing** — reduced to match proportions of other arrow styles at the same stroke width.
- **Editor scroll behavior** — mouse wheel now scrolls content vertically (instead of zooming). No elastic bounce when content fits within the window. Scrollbar tracks extend to window edges.
- **Editor toolbar spacing** — increased margins for bottom and right toolbars in the editor window.
- **Toolbar overlap** — right toolbar moves out of the bottom toolbar's way instead of vice versa, with vertical fallback when horizontal shift isn't enough.
- **Hotkey display** — added F13–F20, arrow keys, and other special keys to the key name map in Preferences.

### Fixed
- **Scroll capture stitch glitches** — the frame stability fix above is the primary fix. Previously, capturing mid-render frames (especially in Chrome and Electron apps) produced horizontal line artifacts, shifted rows, and misaligned seams in the stitched output.
- **Video editor save failure** — when the recording directory bookmark is invalid or inaccessible, the save button now falls back to a Save As panel instead of silently failing.

### Removed
- **Velocity pencil mode** — removed the experimental per-point stroke width feature. The variable-width rendering had visual artifacts and the velocity tracking was unreliable with Chaikin smoothing.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Window snap beautify with native chrome** — snapping a window now captures it independently (with transparent corners) and renders it on the gradient background using the real window chrome instead of a synthetic title bar.
- **"Copy to clipboard" recording option** — new post-recording action in both the toolbar popover and Preferences. GIF recordings copy inline data; MP4 copies the file URL.
- **"Open from Clipboard" menu item** — paste an image from the clipboard directly into the editor.
- **Quick capture mode dropdown** — replaced the "Auto-copy to clipboard" checkbox with a 3-option dropdown: Save / Copy / Save+Copy.

### Changed
- **Auto-measure: click to commit** — holding `1`/`2` shows a live preview that follows the cursor; click to place the measurement, release the key to dismiss. Previously committed on key release, causing accidental placements.
- **Auto-measure performance** — cached bitmap context and helper text size to eliminate per-frame allocations during mouse tracking.
- **Options row centering in editor** — the tool options bar now centers correctly relative to the editor container, not the document view.

### Fixed
- **Clipboard copy pastes as JPG in browsers** — clipboard now explicitly sets PNG data instead of using NSImage's default TIFF representation, matching native macOS screenshot behavior. Previously, apps like browsers would interpret the TIFF as JPG.
- **Save button not applying beautify/effects** — the Save toolbar button now applies post-processing (effects, beautify) before saving, matching the confirm flow.
- **Preferences toolbar actions layout** — split the tools list into "Bottom Toolbar Actions" and "Right Toolbar Actions" sections matching their actual positions.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Scroll capture auto-scroll button** — new "Auto Scroll" button in the scroll capture HUD replaces unreliable keyboard shortcuts. Click to start/stop automatic scrolling of the target window.
- **Accessibility permission prompt** — clicking Auto Scroll when Accessibility permission is not granted shows a dialog explaining why it's needed and offers to open System Settings.
- **"Remember last selected tool" preference** — new toggle in Preferences > General (on by default). When disabled, each new capture starts with the Arrow tool and resets effects/beautify.

### Changed
- **Scroll capture stitching quality** — improved stitch accuracy with triple-fallback shift detection (exact row matching → pixel refinement → original offset), scroll-settle-capture cycle to avoid mid-render captures, and wider search bands for alignment.
- **Scroll capture auto-stop** — no longer triggers when cursor hovers over the HUD panel; only counts zero-shift frames when cursor is inside the capture region.
- **Tool options row width** — the secondary toolbar now expands to fit its content when wider than the main toolbar, preventing controls from being clipped when tools are disabled.
- **Preferences "Tools" tab reorganized** — toolbar actions split into "Bottom Toolbar Actions" and "Right Toolbar Actions" sections matching where buttons actually appear.

### Fixed
- **Scroll capture keyboard shortcuts unreliable** — Tab key was intercepted by the target app (e.g. browser) instead of toggling auto-scroll. Replaced with clickable HUD buttons.
- **Auto-scroll not scrolling target window** — fixed cursor warp coordinate conversion for multi-monitor, target app re-activation after HUD click, and switched to line-based scroll units for broad app compatibility.
- **Effects preset persisting unexpectedly** — when "Remember last selected tool" is off, effects and beautify state are now properly cleared between captures.

## [3.4.5] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Thumbnail right-click menu** — right-click any floating thumbnail preview to "Close All" or "Save All to Folder…" for batch operations.

### Changed
- **Overlay window level raised** — overlay now appears above modal panels, alerts, and security software popups (e.g. LuLu firewall).
- **Enter/quick-capture defaults to clipboard** — new installs default to copy-to-clipboard instead of save-to-file on Enter.
- **Instant clipboard copy** — clipboard copy uses lazy encoding via `writeObjects`, making it instant regardless of image format.
- **Confirm dismisses immediately** — the overlay closes before post-processing (effects/beautify), so the user can continue working sooner.
- **History always saves as PNG** — screenshot history uses PNG internally regardless of the configured save format, eliminating slow WebP/HEIC encodes on clipboard-only captures.

### Fixed
- **Save button always saves to file** — the "Save" toolbar button now always saves to the configured directory, independent of the Enter/quick-capture preference.
- **Save As / stamp file picker hidden behind overlay** — file dialogs now appear above the overlay window (level 258).
- **WebP encoding corruption** — fixed broken WebP output caused by Swift-WebP's macOS encoder using wrong stride (RGB instead of RGBA) and logical size instead of pixel dimensions. Now uses the CGImage RGBA path directly.
- **Floating thumbnail stuck mid-slide** — fixed thumbnails getting stuck partway through their slide-in animation when taking rapid screenshots, caused by `moveTo` reading an in-flight animation position.
- **List picker hover glitch on scroll** — fixed hover highlights getting stuck on multiple rows when scrolling the language picker (or other list popovers) with the scroll wheel.
- **Tool cursor shown over popovers** — popovers now always show the arrow cursor instead of the active tool's cursor.
- **CATransaction flush before activate** — overlay windows render before app activation to prevent a flash of the deactivating app underneath.

## [3.4.4] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Image effects (Adjust)** — new "Adjust" button in the toolbar with non-destructive CIFilter-based image effects. Includes 8 presets (Noir, Mono, Sepia, Chrome, Fade, Instant, Vivid) and 4 adjustment sliders (Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Sharpness). Works independently of Beautify — use effects alone, with Beautify, or both. Live preview in the overlay.
- **Auto-blur/pixelate faces** — one-click face detection using Apple Vision to blur or pixelate all faces in the selection. Available in the blur/pixelate tool options row.
- **Auto-blur/pixelate people** — one-click human body detection to blur or pixelate all people in the selection.
- **Text Only draw mode** — segmented control in blur/pixelate options to switch between "All" (blur everything in drawn rectangle) and "Text Only" (OCR the drawn rectangle, blur only detected text lines). Matches Shottr-style content-aware blur.

### Changed
- **Improved blur/pixelate options row** — reorganized with clear grouping: "Draw" mode selector, "Auto" detection buttons (All Text, PII, Types), and detection buttons (Faces, People). Dimmed section labels and pipe separators make the layout easier to scan.
- **Centralized post-processing pipeline** — effects and beautify are now applied through a single `applyPostProcessing` method in the editor, reducing code duplication across 6 output paths.

## [3.4.3] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Editor window not opening** — fixed "Open in Editor" button not working due to the app hiding itself before the editor window could appear.

## [3.4.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Recording settings popover** — gear icon in the recording toolbar opens a quick-access popover to change format (MP4/GIF), FPS, and post-recording action for the current session without changing Preferences defaults.
- **Auto-copy OCR text** — OCR results are automatically copied to the clipboard when the OCR window opens. Toggle in Preferences > General (default: on).
- **"Open editor" recording option** — new default post-recording action that opens the video editor. Available in both the toolbar popover and Preferences.

### Changed
- **Beautify gradient picker stays open** — clicking a gradient swatch no longer dismisses the popover, so you can quickly preview multiple styles.

### Fixed
- **ESC restores previous app focus** — pressing Escape to cancel a capture now returns focus to the previously active application (e.g. Chrome) instead of leaving macshot active with nothing visible.
- **Resize handles in recording setup** — selection resize handles (corner/edge circles) now appear during recording setup mode, matching screenshot mode behavior.
- **GIF recording speed** — fixed GIF recordings appearing sped up due to incorrect frame decimation math. The GIF encoder now uses the actual recording FPS instead of a hardcoded 60fps estimate.
- **Google Drive upload reliability** — uploads now use a dedicated session with longer timeouts (5 min), automatic retry with backoff on network errors, and token refresh on 401 responses mid-upload.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Add Capture** — new button in the editor top bar to capture additional screen regions and compose them into a single image. The added capture is placed as a draggable stamp; the canvas auto-resizes to fit all content and trims empty space when you reposition it.

### Fixed
- **Cursor update crash** — fixed an infinite recursion in AppKit's `cursorUpdate:` → `hitTest:` chain that caused a stack overflow crash, particularly when using the editor with scroll views.
- **Checkbox text color in light mode** — "Smooth" (pencil) and "On" (beautify) toggle labels are now always white, fixing near-invisible black text on systems using light appearance.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- **Simplified screen recording** — recording now dismisses the capture overlay when you press Start. A floating timer pill and selection border remain visible during recording. Stop recording via the clickable timer pill or the menu bar icon (which becomes a stop button).
- **Menu bar stop button** — the menu bar icon turns into a red stop button during recording, even if the user had hidden it in Preferences. The icon restores to normal after recording ends.
- **Capture Screen targets active monitor** — "Capture Screen" and "Record Screen" now only apply full-screen selection on the monitor where the mouse cursor is, instead of all connected screens.
- **Improved audio quality** — mic recording upgraded to 192kbps stereo; system audio to 192kbps with max quality preset.
- **Large internal refactor** — annotation tool handlers extracted into dedicated protocol-based classes, toolbar UI migrated to proper AppKit components (NSPopover, NSView-based strips), and recording flow simplified by removing annotation-during-recording mode.

### Fixed
- **Cross-screen resize handles** — resize handles now appear on both screens during a cross-screen selection, and dragging handles from the secondary screen correctly resizes the selection on the primary.
- **Cross-screen resize sync** — resizing a selection edge from the secondary screen no longer snaps the opposite edge to the screen boundary.
- **Window snap on secondary screen** — window snap highlights no longer appear on secondary screens while a selection is active.
- **Selection resize during recording setup** — the selection area can now be resized and moved while in recording setup mode (before pressing Start).
- **Move button stuck state** — the Move Selection button no longer stays visually pressed after releasing the drag.
- **Tool preview cleanup on mode switch** — marker cursor preview, loupe preview, stamp preview, and color sampler preview are now properly cleared when switching to recording mode.
- **Recording HUD on all desktops** — the recording timer pill now follows across desktop spaces (previously only visible on the space where recording started).
- **Keyboard focus after cross-screen resize** — Enter/Cmd+C now work immediately after resizing a selection from the secondary screen.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Multi-language OCR** — Vision auto-detects Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and all other supported languages on macOS 13+ (macOS 12 behavior unchanged)
- **Cross-screen selection** — drag a selection across multiple monitors. The selection highlight appears on both screens and the captured image is stitched from all overlapping displays.
- **Recording save folder** — optional separate save directory for recordings in Preferences > Recording. Falls back to the general screenshot folder if not set.
- **Video editor Save As** — click the chevron arrow on the Save button to choose a custom save location. Save button now shows the filename in the status bar after saving.
- **Contributing guide** — added CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors

### Changed
- **Video editor save flow** — Save now copies to the configured save directory instead of revealing the temp file. Finder button is grayed out until the file is saved. Temp files are cleaned up when the editor closes.
- **Window title in filename** — now uses CGWindowList API instead of Accessibility API, removing the need for Accessibility permission
- **Mic permission timing** — microphone permission is now requested before recording starts, not during. Prevents frozen timer and recording of the permission dialog.

### Fixed
- **Window snap on vertical monitors** — fixed window highlighting showing wrong windows when monitors are stacked vertically (CG→AppKit Y conversion used wrong reference height)
- **Multi-monitor selection cleanup** — starting a new selection on one monitor now clears the selection on all other monitors
- **Recording crop rect on vertical monitors** — fixed incorrect Y coordinate conversion that could cause recording to fail or capture the wrong region on vertically stacked displays (thanks @vo1x)
- **Shortcut recorder stuck on "Waiting..."** — fixed the preferences shortcut recorder getting stuck when clicking the Record button again without pressing a key (thanks @vo1x)

## [3.2.6] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Window title in filename** — new preference (off by default) to include the focused window's title in saved screenshot filenames (e.g. `Screenshot 2026-03-26 at 14.30.00 — My Document.png`)
- **Enter key action preference** — new "Enter key action" setting in Preferences to choose whether pressing Enter saves to file or copies to clipboard. Previously this was labeled "Right-click action" and only affected right-click behavior.

### Changed
- **Enter key respects confirm action** — pressing Enter in the overlay now follows the "Enter key action" preference. If set to "Save to file", Enter saves directly to the configured folder instead of copying to clipboard. Cmd+C always copies.
- **Quick Capture + F key** — pressing F (full screen) in Quick Capture mode now immediately saves/copies instead of expanding the selection and showing toolbars
- **Removed right-click selection from overlay** — right-click no longer starts a quick-save selection in the capture overlay. Use the dedicated Quick Capture shortcut instead. Other right-click actions (color wheel, toolbar context menus, anchor points, color sampler copy) are unchanged.

### Fixed
- **Save to file on Enter** — fixed a bug where pressing Enter always copied to clipboard even when "Save to file" was selected in preferences

## [3.2.5] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Microphone recording** — record voice audio during screen recordings. New mic toggle button in the recording toolbar (off by default). Microphone permission is requested only when first enabled — users who don't need it are never prompted. Audio is written as a separate track in the MP4 file.
- **Multi-anchor lines & arrows** — right-click (or Control-click) any line or arrow annotation to add anchor points. Drag individual anchors to create complex curves through multiple waypoints. Smooth Catmull-Rom spline rendering through all points.
- **Share button** — new share button in the right toolbar opens the native macOS sharing menu (AirDrop, Messages, Mail, etc.)
- **Number format options** — number annotations now support four formats: numeric (1, 2, 3), uppercase Roman (I, II, III), uppercase letters (A, B, C), and lowercase letters (a, b, c). Start-at value adjustable via stepper in the options row.
- **"Right-click to add points" hint** — subtle hint text in the secondary toolbar when line or arrow tools are selected

### Changed
- **Loupe performance** — loupe annotations now use the raw screenshot instead of the composited image, eliminating O(n²) re-rendering lag when placing multiple loupes
- **Delay capture moved to menu bar** — the per-capture delay toolbar button has been removed. Delay is now a persistent setting in the menu bar only.

### Fixed
- **Sparkle auto-updates** — fixed CI signing pipeline that was re-signing Sparkle's XPC installer services with the app's sandbox entitlements, preventing the updater from writing to the app bundle. XPC services are now signed without sandbox entitlements as Sparkle requires.
- **Number tool crash** — fixed crash when switching to the number tool with alpha format and start-at value of 0. Input is now clamped and stepper minimum raised to 1.
- **Annotation bounding rect** — bounding rectangle now accounts for all anchor points and control points, fixing hit-testing and selection for complex curved annotations

## [3.2.3] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Pre-capture delay** — new "Capture Delay" submenu in the menu bar with None/3s/5s/10s/30s options. Applies to all capture and recording hotkeys. Countdown shown before screen freeze. Press Escape to cancel.
- **Record Screen auto-start** — when capture delay is set, Record Screen starts recording automatically after countdown (no manual click needed)
- **Control-click to copy color** — color sampler now supports Control+click as alternative to right-click for copying hex values (improves compatibility with BetterTouchTool and other gesture tools)

### Changed
- **Delay capture moved to menu bar** — the per-capture delay toolbar button has been removed. Delay is now a persistent setting in the menu bar, applying to all captures. Simpler UX, matches how other screenshot apps work.
- **Loupe performance** — loupe annotations now use the raw screenshot instead of the composited image, eliminating O(n²) re-rendering lag when placing multiple loupes
- **Removed C-to-copy shortcut** — color hex copy is now right-click only (or Control+click). C key is freed for future use.

### Fixed
- **Sparkle auto-updates from DMG** — fixed entitlements not expanding `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)` in CI builds, which broke the XPC installer service. Auto-updates now work for DMG installs. Users on 3.2.2 or earlier need to manually reinstall once.

## [3.2.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Capture cursor setting** — new "Capture mouse cursor in screenshot" toggle in Preferences (off by default)
- **Editor reset zoom button** — new button in editor top bar (left of zoom %) to reset zoom and recenter image
- **Beautify in editor** — beautify preview now works in the editor window (previously overlay-only)

### Changed
- **Editor architecture refactor** — editor is now a proper `EditorView` subclass of `OverlayView` instead of branching via `isDetached` boolean. Cleaner code, fewer edge cases, shared annotation/toolbar code via inheritance.
- **Marker/pencil Shift constraint** — Shift now constrains to horizontal/vertical only (not 45°), locks direction for the entire stroke
- **"Add to My Colors" button removed** — redundant; color slots auto-save when using color sampler tool
- **Auto-save to color slots** — only happens when color sampler tool is active, not on every color pick
- **OCR Copy button** — now closes the OCR window after copying
- **OCR AI Search button** — now closes the OCR window after opening browser

### Fixed
- **Editor window coordinate system** — comprehensive fix for all tools in editor mode: text, loupe, pixelate, blur, color sampler, crop, stamp, auto-redact, beautify, and remove background now all work at correct positions
- **Editor crop tool** — crop selection, preview, and commit all use correct canvas coordinates; undo/redo properly restores image size and recenters
- **Editor zoom** — smooth zoom without random jumps or recentering; canvas offset freezes when zoomed to prevent fighting with zoom anchor
- **Editor window sizing** — window now accounts for max beautify padding/shadow to prevent overflow
- **Editor title bar cursor** — cursor no longer shows tool-specific icon over traffic lights and title bar
- **Beautify shadow bleed** — fixed raw screenshot content showing through shadow area in editor
- **Remove background in editor** — now shows floating thumbnail preview (same as overlay mode)
- **Marker cursor preview** — now visible when beautify mode is active
- **Crop preview with beautify** — crop selection overlay now visible when beautify mode is active

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Multi-monitor recording** — recording on a secondary display no longer captures the wrong screen. Display matching now uses `CGDirectDisplayID` instead of fragile coordinate comparison. Same fix applied to scroll capture.
- **Cursor flickering on toolbars** — eliminated cursor flicker (crosshair/arrow alternation) when hovering over toolbars in the overlay. Replaced AppKit cursor rect system with fully imperative cursor management that avoids cross-window conflicts on multi-monitor setups and with background editor windows.
- **Editor annotation coordinates** — annotations transferred to the editor window now render at the correct position. Replaced the old approach of shifting annotation coordinates in `draw()` with a pure rendering offset (`editorCanvasOffset`), eliminating coordinate drift.
- **Editor selection resize** — selection handle hit-testing is now disabled in the editor, preventing accidental resizing of the image canvas when clicking near edges.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **S3-compatible uploads** — upload screenshots and videos to AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze B2, and other S3-compatible services. Configure endpoint, credentials, bucket, and public URL in Preferences.
- **Quick Capture shortcut** (`Cmd+Shift+S`) — select area and instantly save/copy without the annotation toolbar. Same as right-click drag, but as a global hotkey.
- **Capture OCR shortcut** (`Cmd+Shift+T`) — select area and immediately extract text via OCR. No toolbar, straight to the OCR results window.
- **Space-to-reposition mid-drag** — hold Space while drawing any shape or selection to reposition it without changing its size. Standard design tool behavior (Photoshop, Figma, Sketch).
- **Save button quick-save** — left-click Save now instantly saves to the configured folder. Right-click for "Save As..." dialog. Context menu indicator triangle shown on button.
- **Hide menu bar icon** — new toggle in Preferences. Hotkeys still work. Re-launch macshot from Spotlight to restore the icon.
- **Shortcut clear buttons** — each keyboard shortcut in Preferences now has a "x" button to disable it. Field shows "None" when cleared.
- **Menu bar icons** — all status bar menu items now have SF Symbol icons.
- **Color sampler right-click to copy** — right-click with the eyedropper to copy hex value to clipboard instead of pressing C.
- **Color picker slot system** — custom color slots always have one selected. Any color you pick (swatch, gradient, or eyedropper) auto-saves to the selected slot. Slots auto-advance when using the eyedropper for rapid palette collection. Right-click a slot to clear it.
- **Color picker stays open** — clicking on the screenshot with the color picker open now samples the color and keeps the picker visible. Switching to the eyedropper tool also keeps the picker open.

### Changed
- **Menu bar icon size** — reduced from 26px to 22px to match other menu bar apps.
- **Upload toast redesign** — moved from bottom-right to top-center. Native macOS notification appearance with app icon, light/dark mode support, and "Open" button for upload links. Click anywhere to dismiss. Error messages now word-wrap instead of truncating.
- **Floating thumbnail hover** — auto-dismiss timer now pauses while the cursor is over the thumbnail. Timer resumes when the cursor leaves.
- **Video editor responsive layout** — buttons collapse to icon-only when the window is narrow, preventing overlap.

### Fixed
- **Dock icon lifecycle** — dock icon now appears when Preferences, Editor, or Video Editor windows are open, and hides when all are closed. Fixed a bug where closing the video editor didn't remove the dock icon.
- **Duplicate instances** — launching macshot while it's already running now activates the existing instance instead of starting a second one.
- **Space switching** — switching macOS spaces now automatically dismisses the capture overlay.
- **OCR window Cmd+W** — the OCR results window can now be closed with Cmd+W.
- **Upload confirmation dialog** — now shows the correct provider name ("Upload to S3?" / "Upload to Google Drive?" / "Upload to imgbb?") based on the selected provider.
- **Editor tall image scrolling** — tall screenshots (e.g. from scroll capture) can now be scrolled at 1x zoom in the editor. Previously required zooming in first.
- **Zoom position preservation** — zooming back to 100% in the editor no longer resets the scroll position.
- **Space key beep** — holding Space to reposition no longer produces system beep sounds from key repeat.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **App Sandbox** — macshot is now fully sandboxed with minimal entitlements (network client, user-selected files, bookmarks). Improved security posture.
- **macOS 12.3+ support** — minimum deployment target lowered from macOS 14.0 to macOS 12.3 (Monterey). Features unavailable on older versions gracefully degrade:
  - Background removal requires macOS 14+
  - Launch at login requires macOS 13+
  - Mesh gradients require macOS 15+
  - System audio recording requires macOS 13+
- **Google AI Search in OCR** — new button in OCR results window to search extracted text directly in Google AI mode.
- **Error toast improvements** — upload error messages now word-wrap instead of truncating, with expanded toast height.
- **Video editor error colors** — errors now display in red instead of green.

### Changed
- **Google Drive OAuth** — replaced loopback HTTP server with ASWebAuthenticationSession and a new iOS-type OAuth client. More secure, sandbox-compatible, no local server socket.
- **Screen capture engine** — replaced SCScreenshotManager (macOS 14+) with SCStream-based single-frame capture compatible with macOS 12.3+.
- **Modernized image rendering** — replaced all deprecated `lockFocus()`/`unlockFocus()` calls (~32 occurrences) with `NSImage(size:flipped:drawingHandler:)`.
- **Recording output** — recordings now save to temp directory; final export via video editor Save button.
- **Save directory** — now uses security-scoped bookmarks for sandbox compatibility. Save directory preference persists across launches.

### Fixed
- **Video recording in sandbox** — recordings were failing because security-scoped access was released before the video editor could open the file.
- **GIFEncoder thread safety** — added locking to prevent data races on frame counters.
- **Force unwrap crashes** — replaced `NSScreen.main!` with safe fallbacks.

### Breaking Changes
- **Google Drive:** You will need to re-sign in to Google Drive after updating. The OAuth client has changed.
- **Screenshot history:** Local screenshot history will be cleared on first launch due to sandbox container migration. New screenshots will be saved normally.
- **Save directory:** You may need to re-select your custom save directory in Preferences after updating.

## [3.0.8] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Invert Colors** — new toolbar button to invert colors in the selected region. Apply twice to revert. Supports undo. Can be disabled in Preferences → Tools.
- **Mouse wheel zoom** — scroll wheel now zooms in/out without holding Cmd (trackpad behavior unchanged).

### Fixed
- **First click ignored on slower Macs** — overlay now accepts clicks immediately via `acceptsFirstMouse`, fixing a race condition where the first selection drag was dropped on Intel Macs or when app activation was slow.
- **Blurry captures on mixed-DPI setups** — screenshots from a 1x external monitor were being interpolation-upscaled to 2x when a Retina display was also connected. Output now matches the source display's native pixel density.

## [3.0.7] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Mesh gradients** — 7 new organic, multi-directional gradient backgrounds using SwiftUI MeshGradient (macOS 15+ only, hidden on macOS 14). Shown first in the gradient picker.
- **Beautify on/off toggle** — dedicated toggle switch in the beautify options row to enable/disable the effect independently from the tool.
- **Beautify active indicator** — sparkles icon turns gold when the beautify effect is enabled, visible even when using other tools.

### Improved
- **Beautify is now a proper tool mode** — clicking the sparkles button deselects the current drawing tool and shows the beautify options row. No more confusing 3-click toggle cycle.
- **Gradient picker hit area** — the dropdown triangle next to the gradient swatch is now clickable to open/close the picker.
- **Gradient picker cursor** — arrow cursor over the expanded gradient dropdown instead of crosshair.

### Fixed
- **Crosshair cursor stuck after cancel** — cursor now explicitly resets to arrow when dismissing the overlay, preventing stale crosshair on desktop/fullscreen apps.
- **Loupe/stamp cursor in beautify mode** — loupe preview and stamp cursor no longer persist when switching to beautify mode.

### Removed
- 5 duplicate gradient styles (Warm, Arctic, Mint, Charcoal, Steel) that were too similar to existing ones.

## [3.0.6] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Credit card auto-redact** — significantly improved detection of credit card numbers in OCR text. Handles Amex (4-6-5) format, OCR artifacts (฿, @, : appended to digit groups), and numbers split across multiple OCR text blocks. Uses spatial grouping to detect horizontally adjacent digit groups on the same row and redacts them as a card number.

## [3.0.5] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Annotation rotation** — shapes (rectangle, ellipse, stamp, text, number, pixelate, blur) can be rotated via a rotation handle above the selection box. Hold Shift to snap to 90° steps. Works in both Select tool and hover-to-move (quick edit) mode.
- **Stamp tool shortcut** — press `G` to switch to the stamp/emoji tool.
- **About tab** — Preferences now has an About tab showing version, description, author, and GitHub link.
- **Redact button hover/press states** — "Blur All Text" and "Auto-Redact PII" buttons now visually respond to hover and click.

### Improved
- **Beautify output** — removed outer background radius to eliminate subpixel gap artifacts on exported images. Gradient fills edge-to-edge.
- **Thick arrow smoothness** — increased curve sampling from 24 to 64 points for smoother bends. Shape scales down proportionally when short.
- **Thick arrow hit test** — uses distance-to-curve instead of bounding rect for more accurate hover/click detection.
- **Rotation handle UX** — arrow cursor over handle, icon centered in circle, handle reachable in quick edit mode.
- **Menu bar order** — "Show History Panel" moved below "Recent Captures" for logical grouping.

### Fixed
- **Resize handles after rotation** — click point is inverse-rotated into annotation's local space so handles work correctly at any rotation angle.
- **Rotation direction** — dragging the handle clockwise now rotates the shape clockwise (was inverted).
- **Debug logging** — all print/NSLog statements wrapped in `#if DEBUG`.
- **Dead code** — removed unused `showRecordingCompletedToast` function.
- **README** — updated beautify style count (28), added global hotkeys table, added stamp shortcut.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **System audio recording** — toggle in the recording toolbar to capture system audio alongside screen video. Off by default. Recorded as AAC 48kHz stereo in MP4. macshot's own sounds are excluded. The mute toggle in the video editor can strip audio on export.
- **120fps recording** — added 120fps option for MP4 recording on supported displays (ProMotion).
- **GIF FPS cap in preferences** — when GIF format is selected, the FPS dropdown shows only 5/10/15fps options instead of the full range.
- **Upload progress percentage** — Google Drive uploads in the video editor now show real-time progress ("Uploading to Drive... 47%").
- **Video resolution display** — video editor info bar now shows pixel dimensions (e.g. "1920×1080") alongside format, file size, and FPS.
- **GIF playback timeline** — GIF files in the video editor now have a moving playhead and time labels matching the MP4 experience.

### Improved
- **Recording toolbar icons** — screenshot mode shows a camera icon (video.fill) for "switch to record mode", recording mode shows a red circle (record.circle) for "start recording", and a red square for "stop". Clearer than the previous play/stop icons.
- **Beautify rounded corners** — shadow is now rendered via transparency layer on the image itself, eliminating the white corner artifacts and edge lines from the previous shadow fill approach.
- **Stamp preview suppressed during recording** — emoji cursor preview no longer follows the mouse when in recording mode.
- **Auto-select first emoji** — switching to the stamp tool automatically selects the first emoji instead of showing an error. Highlight tracking is now reliable across all selection methods.

### Fixed
- **Recording duration shows hours** — fixed audio track causing the MP4 file to report a duration of hundreds of hours. The session now starts at the first video frame's timestamp so audio and video are properly aligned.
- **Video editor duration** — uses video track duration instead of asset duration, so audio track length doesn't inflate the timeline.
- **Video playback starts from trim start** — play button now always starts from trim start if the playhead is outside the trimmed range.
- **GIF editor window sizing** — GIF editor window no longer expands to fill the screen. NSImageView compression resistance set to low so it respects the window size.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Video editor window** — after recording stops, a dedicated editor window opens with video playback, a trim timeline with draggable start/end handles, and action buttons: Play/Pause (Space bar), Save, Upload to Google Drive, Reveal in Finder, Copy Path. Trim handles let you cut the beginning and end of the video before exporting.
- **Mute audio toggle** — speaker icon in the video editor strips audio from exports when enabled.
- **Google Drive integration** — upload screenshots and videos directly to your Google Drive. Sign in via OAuth2 in Preferences → Uploads. Files are stored in a private "macshot" folder. Token refresh is automatic — sign in once, stay signed in. Supports both images (PNG) and videos (MP4/GIF).
- **Upload provider selector** — choose between imgbb (images only) and Google Drive (images + videos) in Preferences → Uploads.
- **Redesigned Uploads tab** — provider selector, Google Drive sign-in/sign-out, imgbb API key, and upload history all in one tab.

### Fixed
- **Upload confirm dialog** — now shows "Upload to Google Drive?" when Drive is the selected provider instead of always showing imgbb.
- **Upload toast delete button** — "Delete from server" button is now hidden for Google Drive uploads (which have no delete URL).
- **Video playhead clamping** — the playhead circle no longer goes past the timeline edges near the beginning/end.
- **Video trim playback** — play always starts from trim start (not video start) and resets to exact trim start position with zero-tolerance seek.
- **Keychain prompts** — replaced Keychain token storage with file-based storage in Application Support to eliminate repeated "confidential information" prompts on rebuild/update.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **History overlay** — press `Cmd+Shift+H` (or "Show History" from menu bar) to see all recent captures as a full-screen card grid. Click any card to copy it to clipboard. ESC or click outside to dismiss. Hotkey configurable in Preferences.
- **Horizontal scroll capture** — scroll capture now auto-detects horizontal scrolling. On the first scroll, the direction (vertical or horizontal) is locked for the session. Horizontal scrolls stitch content left-to-right or right-to-left.

### Fixed
- **Shift + snap guide conflict** — holding Shift while drawing constrained shapes (straight lines, 45° angles, perfect squares) no longer gets nudged by snap alignment guides. Shift constraint now takes priority.
- **ESC in recording mode (Record Screen)** — pressing ESC before starting capture now correctly closes the overlay. The recording control window activates macshot so it can receive keyboard events.
- **Stop recording requires two clicks** — the recording control window now accepts the first mouse click immediately (`acceptsFirstMouse`) instead of consuming it for window activation.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Text box with visible bounds** — text annotations now show a resizable dashed border while editing. Drag any of the 8 handles to resize the box; text automatically reflows to fit the new width.
- **Text alignment** — left, center, and right alignment buttons in the text secondary toolbar. Applied live while editing.
- **Click to re-edit text** — with the text tool active, clicking on an existing text annotation opens it for editing with all formatting restored (font, size, style, alignment, fill, outline). Cancel (ESC) restores the original.
- **Text background & outline** — "Fill" and "Outline" toggle buttons in the text secondary toolbar. Left-click toggles on/off, right-click opens the full color picker to choose the color. Both render as a rounded pill behind/around the text, visible live during editing.
- **Measure unit toggle** — px/pt segment control in the measure tool options row. Switch between pixel values (Retina-scaled) and point values (1:1 with design tools). Persisted across sessions.

### Fixed
- **Color picker behind text** — when opening the color picker for text Fill/Outline, the text view is temporarily hidden so the picker is fully visible. Text content is rendered manually in its place.
- **Text box doesn't expand on newline** — the dashed border and resize handles now update immediately when pressing Enter to add new lines.
- **Thick arrow corners** — all 3 corners of the thick arrow's triangle head are now consistently rounded using quadratic bezier curves through each corner point.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Stamp / Emoji tool** — place emojis and images on your screenshots. 21 common emojis in the quick bar, a categorized emoji picker with 5 tabs (Faces, Hands, Symbols, Objects, Flags) and 100+ emojis, plus a "Load Image" button to stamp any PNG/JPEG. Stamps are placed at click position, movable and resizable with the standard 8-handle box. A semi-transparent preview follows the cursor before placement.
- **Arrow styles** — 5 arrow head styles selectable in the secondary toolbar: single (default), thick/banner (tapered solid shape), double-headed, open/chevron, and tail (circle at start). Persisted across sessions.
- **Shape fill modes** — rectangle and ellipse tools now have 3 fill modes in the secondary toolbar: stroke only, stroke + semi-transparent fill, and solid fill. Respects color opacity. Replaces the separate "Filled Rectangle" tool.
- **Record Area / Record Screen** — "Record Screen" renamed to "Record Area" (select region to record). New "Record Screen" opens the recording UI with the full screen already selected, ready to press play.
- **Mouse click highlights** — toggle in the recording toolbar to show expanding yellow rings at click positions during screen recording.

### Improved
- **Arrow scaling** — arrowheads now scale down proportionally when the arrow is short, preventing the oversized head problem at the start of a drag.
- **Editor top bar icons** — crop, flip horizontal, and flip vertical buttons now use the same white-tinted SF Symbol style as the main toolbar (was using default system coloring that looked bad on dark backgrounds).
- **Secondary toolbar positioning** — the options row now flips above the main toolbar when it would go off-screen (fixes full-screen selection clipping).
- **Recording mode transition** — clicking the Record button now properly enters pass-through mode: hides the bottom toolbar and options row, activates the window underneath for interaction, and shows the recording control panel. Previously the bottom toolbar stayed visible and drawing was still possible.
- **Recording control window cleanup** — the recording control panel is now properly dismissed when recording stops (previously could get orphaned and stuck on screen).
- **ESC in recording mode** — pressing ESC before starting capture now correctly closes the overlay. The recording control window accepts keyboard focus for this.
- **Paste in text tool** — Cmd+V, Cmd+C, Cmd+X, Cmd+A, and Cmd+Z now work correctly while editing text annotations.

### Fixed
- **`isCapturingVideo` not reset** — recording state flag was never cleared in `reset()`, breaking state machine invariants.
- **State mutation in draw()** — mouse highlight pruning was happening inside `draw(_:)`, violating AppKit's drawing contract. Moved to async callback.
- **Mouse highlight position** — click highlights now use the actual event location instead of a potentially stale `NSEvent.mouseLocation`.

### Removed
- **Filled Rectangle tool** — merged into the Rectangle tool with a fill mode selector (stroke / stroke+fill / fill).
- **Keystroke overlay** — removed the "Show Keystrokes" recording feature.
- **Dead code** — removed unreachable record options picker code.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Snap alignment guides** — when drawing or moving annotations, edges and centers snap to the selection midlines and existing annotation edges/centers. Cyan dashed guide lines appear at snap points. Toggleable in Preferences (on by default).
- **Auto-redact in blur/pixelate tools** — auto-redact PII and "redact all text" buttons are now in the blur/pixelate options row (removed from right toolbar). Redactions use the active tool's style (blur or pixelate) instead of always using filled rectangles.
- **Redact all text** — new button in blur/pixelate options row that detects and redacts all text in the selection, not just PII patterns.
- **Dotted rectangle corner dots** — dotted-style rectangles now always have a dot at every corner with evenly-spaced dots per side, instead of the previous uneven pattern.
- **Custom cursors** — pencil tool shows a pen cursor; select/move tool shows a 4-arrow move cursor only when hovering over movable annotations (arrow cursor elsewhere). Both cursors have white fill with dark outline for visibility on any background.
- **Shift-constrain on resize** — holding Shift while resizing existing annotations constrains lines/arrows/measure to 45° angles and rectangles/ellipses to squares/circles.

### Improved
- **Pencil hover-to-move removed** — the pencil tool no longer shows edit controls when hovering near existing annotations, preventing accidental moves when drawing close to existing strokes.
- **Redact type dropdown toggle** — clicking the types dropdown when already open now properly closes it.
- **Font picker** — hover highlights items in the dropdown; selecting a font no longer commits/deselects the active text field.
- **Editor right toolbar position** — no longer overlaps the top bar.
- **Bold/italic on system font** — now works correctly with SF Pro via font descriptor traits.
- **Number circle sizing** — all stroke width steps produce visibly different sizes.
- **Number text contrast** — black text on light fill colors for readability.
- **Crop preview** — shows dimmed overlay, white border, and rule-of-thirds grid while dragging.
- **Loupe and color sampler in beautify mode** — previews now render on top of the beautify gradient.
- **Snap guides in beautify mode** — guide lines render on top of the beautify preview.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **WebP encoding crash** — fixed crash when copying or saving as WebP. The encoder was using the wrong pixel format (RGBA) for ScreenCaptureKit images (BGRA). Now uses NSImage-based encoding which handles format conversion automatically.
- **Swift-WebP compatibility** — pinned to v0.5.0 for Xcode 16.4 (Swift 6.1) compatibility. v0.6.1 requires Swift tools 6.2.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Editor top bar** — fixed full-width bar at the top of the editor window with pixel dimensions display, crop button, flip horizontal/vertical buttons, and zoom level indicator.
- **Flip image** — flip the screenshot horizontally or vertically in the editor. All annotations (including freeform strokes and control points) are mirrored to match. Fully undoable.
- **Undoable crop** — cropping in the editor now saves the previous image state, so Cmd+Z restores the full uncropped image.
- **Crop selection preview** — dragging a crop area now shows a live preview with dimmed overlay outside the selection, a white border, and rule-of-thirds grid lines.
- **Number pointer cone** — click-and-drag with the number tool to create a triangular pointer extending from the numbered circle toward where you release. Single-click still places a plain number. Great for pointing numbers at specific areas.
- **Auto-measure** — with the measure tool selected, hold `1` to preview a vertical measurement or `2` for horizontal. The ruler scans outward from the cursor until the pixel color changes, automatically measuring the element you're pointing at. Release to commit, fully undoable.
- **Font picker hover highlight** — hovering over fonts in the dropdown now highlights the item and brightens the text.

### Improved
- **Number circle sizing** — all 7 stroke width steps now produce visibly different circle sizes (was stuck at the same size for steps 1-3).
- **Number text contrast** — text inside number circles is now black for light fill colors (white, yellow, etc.) instead of always white.
- **Bold/italic on system font** — bold and italic buttons now work correctly with the System font (SF Pro). Previously they had no effect because NSFontManager can't convert system font traits; now uses font descriptor traits directly.
- **Font selection preserves text focus** — clicking a font in the dropdown no longer commits/deselects the active text field. The font change applies immediately to the current text.
- **Editor bottom toolbar spacing** — the bottom toolbar is now raised when the secondary options row is visible, so it no longer clips off-screen.
- **Editor right toolbar position** — the right toolbar now sits below the top bar instead of overlapping it.

### Fixed
- **Loupe preview in beautify mode** — the loupe live preview was hidden behind the beautify gradient overlay; now redrawn on top.
- **Text formatting commits text** — clicking bold/italic/underline/strikethrough no longer finalizes the active text field before applying the change.
- **Corner radius slider label overlap** — increased gap between the slider handle and value label.
- **Stroke width slider label overlap** — increased gap between the slider knob and "20px" label.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Redesigned color picker** — modern popup with always-visible HSB gradient, brightness slider, hex color display, and consistent slider thumbs. Preset colors reduced to 12 essential system colors for a cleaner layout.
- **Custom color palette** — 7 saveable color slots that persist across app restarts. Click an empty slot to save the current color, right-click any slot to replace it with the current color (or clear it if it already matches). "Add to My Colors" button at the bottom for quick saving.
- **Color sampler sets drawing color** — clicking with the color sampler (eyedropper) tool now sets the current drawing color to the sampled pixel, in addition to the existing C-to-copy-hex shortcut.

### Fixed
- **Stroke width slider label overlap** — the "20px" label no longer overlaps with the slider knob on the last step.
- **Crosshair cursor over color picker** — the cursor now correctly switches to an arrow when hovering over the color picker popup.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **HEIC format** — save screenshots as HEIC (High Efficiency Image Coding) for ~50% smaller files than JPEG at the same visual quality; uses macOS native encoding via CGImageDestination.
- **WebP format** — save screenshots as WebP for ~25-35% smaller files than JPEG; powered by [Swift-WebP](https://github.com/ainame/Swift-WebP) (libwebp wrapper).
- **Downscale Retina (1x) option** — new "Save at standard resolution (1x)" checkbox in Preferences → Output. Halves pixel dimensions on Retina displays, producing ~4x smaller files. Useful when sharing on Slack, docs, or the web where full Retina resolution is overkill.
- **sRGB color profile embedding** — new "Embed sRGB color profile" checkbox in Preferences → Output (on by default). Ensures consistent colors when screenshots are viewed on different displays or transferred between machines.

### Improved
- **Clipboard copy performance** — eliminated redundant double-encoding (was generating TIFF twice plus the configured format). Now converts once and writes only the configured format to the pasteboard. For a full-screen Retina capture this removes ~30 MB of unnecessary TIFF data from the copy pipeline.
- **Dropped TIFF from clipboard** — the pasteboard no longer includes an uncompressed TIFF representation alongside the configured format. Modern macOS apps all read PNG/JPEG natively; removing TIFF significantly speeds up Cmd+C. HEIC and WebP clipboard copies include a PNG fallback for compatibility.
- **Capture sound caching** — all four code paths that played the capture sound were creating new NSSound objects from disk on every call. Consolidated into a single shared static instance (`AppDelegate.captureSound`) reused everywhere. CoreAudio is pre-warmed at app launch to eliminate the ~1s delay on the first capture after idle.
- **Drag-to-save format** — dragging a floating thumbnail to Finder now saves in the configured format (was hardcoded to PNG).
- **Quality slider scope** — the quality slider in Preferences now applies to JPEG, HEIC, and WebP (was JPEG-only). Disabled for PNG (always lossless).
- **History pixel dimensions** — the "Recent Captures" menu now shows correct pixel dimensions when the Retina downscale option is enabled.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Font family picker** — text tool now has a font dropdown in the secondary toolbar with 22 curated typefaces (System, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Avenir Next, Futura, Georgia, and more), each rendered in its own font for a live preview.
- **Text settings in secondary toolbar** — bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font size, and cancel/confirm controls are now drawn inline in the tool options row, replacing the old floating control bar.

### Improved
- **Beautify gradients redesigned** — 18 new gradient styles (up from 12) organized in 6 rows: warm, blues, pink/purple, greens/nature, dark/moody, and clean/neutral. Includes multi-color 4-stop gradients inspired by modern screenshot tools.
- **Evenly-spaced dashed/dotted lines** — dash and dot patterns on rectangles, ellipses, lines, and arrows now adjust segment size to tile evenly around the shape perimeter, eliminating asymmetric bunching.
- **Dotted freeform strokes** — dotted pencil strokes now place dots at evenly-spaced arc-length positions instead of relying on Core Graphics dash patterns, fixing uneven spacing with smoothing off.
- **Beautify slider spacing** — increased margins between Pad/Rad/Shd/BgR sliders so labels no longer overlap adjacent controls.
- **Default text size** — increased from 16 to 20.

### Fixed
- **Beautify annotation controls** — move/resize handles and selection highlights now draw on top of the beautify preview instead of being hidden behind it.
- **Beautify translate overlay** — translated text overlays now render inside the beautify preview instead of being filtered out.
- **Editor window options row clipping** — the secondary toolbar (tool options row) is now accounted for in the editor window's padding, preventing it from being cut off.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Pencil/marker self-overlap** — drawing over the same area within a single stroke no longer causes the paint to get darker. The entire stroke now composites as one flat layer with uniform opacity.

## [2.5.6] - 2026-03-16

### Improved
- **Floating thumbnail letterboxing** — very thin or very tall screenshots are now shown with dark padding (letterbox bars) in the thumbnail preview, ensuring action buttons are always clickable and the image is never stretched.

## [2.5.5] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Floating thumbnail aspect ratio** — very wide or very tall screenshots no longer appear stretched in the thumbnail preview. The thumbnail now always preserves the original aspect ratio while fitting within size bounds.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Filled rectangle context menu** — right-click menu now shows only the rounded corners toggle (no stroke width rows, since filled rectangles have no border).

## [2.5.3] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Check for Updates dialog** — the Sparkle update dialog now appears immediately on first click instead of requiring a second click (LSUIElement app activation fix).

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Filled rectangle right-click menu** — right-click the filled rectangle tool to access stroke width and rounded corners toggle, matching the outlined rectangle tool.

### Fixed
- **Color picker toggle** — clicking the color button when the picker is already open now closes it instead of flickering closed and reopening.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Rounded corners toggle** — right-click the rectangle or filled rectangle tool to toggle rounded corners on/off. Setting persists across restarts. Corner radius scales proportionally to the rectangle size.

### Fixed
- **Marker preview circle position** — the marker size preview circle no longer jumps back to the start of the stroke when releasing the mouse button without moving.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Auto-updates via Sparkle** — macshot now checks for updates automatically every 30 minutes. Right-click the menu bar icon and choose "Check for Updates..." to check manually. Updates are signed with EdDSA and verified before install.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Tool keyboard shortcuts** — single-key shortcuts active after selecting a region: `A` arrow, `L` line, `P` pencil, `M` marker, `R` rectangle, `T` text, `N` number, `B` blur, `X` pixelate, `I` color sampler, `S` select & edit, `E` open in editor (overlay only).

### Fixed
- **Delay button stays highlighted** — after using delay capture, the delay icon appeared active on the next capture but required an extra click to actually use. Delay state now always resets to off when opening a new capture.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Editor Window (revamped)** — the standalone editor window is back, rebuilt from scratch. Open any capture in a resizable, titled window via the new "Open in Editor Window" toolbar button, or from the floating thumbnail / pin window "Edit" action. Full annotation tools, zoom (0.1×–8×), copy, save, pin, OCR, upload, beautify, and background removal — all work inside the editor. Annotations transfer seamlessly from the overlay with correct coordinate mapping. Multiple editor windows can be open simultaneously; macshot shows a dock icon while any editor is open.
- **Annotation cloning** — `Annotation.clone()` method for safe deep copies when transferring annotations between overlay and editor.

### Improved
- **Editor toolbar layout** — toolbars pin to window edges (bottom-center, top-right) instead of floating relative to the selection. Overlay-only buttons (cancel, move selection, delay, record, scroll capture) are hidden in editor mode.
- **Editor drawing** — dark background with image centered at natural size. No selection border or resize handles. New selections blocked (image bounds are fixed).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Color Picker tool** — new eyedropper tool in the bottom toolbar. Hover over any pixel to see its hex color in real time with a color swatch preview. Press `C` to copy the hex value (e.g. `#FF3B30`) to clipboard. Accurate sRGB sampling. Can be disabled in Preferences like any other tool.
- **Draw outside selection** — annotation strokes (pencil, arrow, line, etc.) can now continue past the selection boundary. Start drawing inside the selection and drag outside freely.
- **Floating thumbnail on copy from overlay** — Cmd+C now shows the floating thumbnail preview in the bottom-right corner, matching the behavior when confirming a capture.

### Improved
- **Loupe tool performance** — live preview no longer creates intermediate images or calls `compositedImage()` on every mouse move. Placed loupes draw directly from the source image. Shadow and gradient objects are cached as statics. Significantly smoother cursor tracking.
- **Marker cursor preview** — now scales correctly with zoom level (drawn inside the zoom transform).
- **Zoom smoothness** — zooming in/out no longer causes a jump when crossing 1x. The zoom transform is continuous at all levels.

### Removed
- **Editor window mode** — the standalone editor window has been removed. All annotation, zoom, crop, and export features work directly in the overlay.

### Fixed
- **Overlay translate clipping** — translated text overlays now stay clipped to the selection rectangle when zoomed, preventing overflow into the dark overlay area.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Scroll Capture** — select a region, click the Scroll Capture button (above Record in the right toolbar), then scroll normally. macshot stitches each captured strip into one seamless tall image using Apple Vision's `VNTranslationalImageRegistrationRequest` for pixel-perfect alignment. Works at any scroll speed; handles both downward and upward scrolling. The full screen turns transparent during capture so you see live content everywhere, not a frozen overlay. Press Stop (or Esc) when done — the result is copied to clipboard and shown as a floating thumbnail.

### Improved
- **Scroll Capture live preview** — entire overlay window is fully transparent during scroll capture so you see live screen content on the whole screen, not just inside the selection rectangle.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Toolbar preferences not respected** — disabling a tool or action in Preferences → Tools would be silently overridden the next time a capture was made. Root cause: the migration code that auto-enables new tools/actions on app updates was treating any tag missing from the stored array as "new", which re-enabled anything the user had just disabled. Fixed by introducing `knownToolRawValues` and `knownActionTags` UserDefaults keys that track which tools/actions have already been introduced; the migration now only adds tags that have never appeared before, so user-disabled items stay disabled.
- **Record screen not toggleable** — the "Record screen" button (tag 1009) was missing from Preferences → Tools → Toolbar Actions, so it could not be hidden. It is now listed alongside the other action toggles.

## [2.1.5] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **~1 s delay on snap/fullscreen confirm** — copying, saving, or pinning a window-snap or full-screen (F key) selection was stalling the main thread for ~1 second before the screenshot sound played. Root cause: `SCScreenshotManager.captureImage` returns an IOSurface-backed CGImage (GPU memory) that is only read back to CPU RAM the first time its pixels are accessed. For manual drag selections the readback happened silently during the drag (many `draw()` calls); for snap/fullscreen the user confirmed before any draw occurred, so the blocking readback hit the main thread at copy/save/pin time. Fix: blit the IOSurface CGImage into a CPU-backed `CGContext` immediately after capture, while still on the background capture thread, so the readback is done before the overlay even appears.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Color opacity slider** — the color picker popup now has an opacity slider below the swatches. Drag it to set transparency for all drawing tools (pencil, line, arrow, rectangle, filled rectangle, ellipse, text, numbered markers). Marker keeps its own fixed highlight opacity. Opacity is remembered across captures within the same session.
- **Floating thumbnail action buttons** — hovering the thumbnail now shows a dark overlay with six action buttons: Copy, Save (center), Close, Pin, Edit, Upload (corners). Clicking anywhere else on the thumbnail dismisses it as before.
- **Stackable thumbnails** — multiple captures now stack vertically instead of replacing each other. When a thumbnail is dismissed, the ones below animate up. Configurable in Preferences: "Stack (keep all)" or "Replace (show only latest)".
- **Configurable thumbnail auto-dismiss** — set how many seconds before the thumbnail auto-dismisses (0 = never). Configurable in Preferences (default: 5 seconds).
- **Remember last selection** — new Preferences toggle: "Remember last selection area". When enabled, the last selection rect is restored on the matching screen every time you open the capture overlay.
- **Hover-to-move annotations** — when a shape or drawing tool is active, hovering over an existing annotation shows its edit controls (handles, delete button) and the open-hand cursor. You can drag it to reposition or click a handle to resize without switching to the Select tool. Delete key also removes the hovered annotation.
- **Marker cursor preview** — while the marker tool is active, a semi-transparent circle follows the cursor showing the exact marker size and color before you start drawing.
- **Delete key removes annotations** — pressing Delete (Backspace) removes the currently selected or hovered annotation without needing to click the ✕ button.
- **Undo/redo deletions** — deleting an annotation (via button or Delete key) is now undoable with Cmd+Z. Previously only additions were undoable.

### Improved
- **Window snap performance** — the `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` lookup now runs on a background thread and skips overlapping queries, eliminating UI stalls when moving the mouse quickly in snap mode.
- **Thumbnail size** — doubled from 160 px max-width to 320 px for better visibility.
- **Quick-save threshold** — a single-pixel drag now counts as a valid selection for right-click quick-save (previously required >5 px in both dimensions).
- **Undo/redo architecture** — rewritten with a proper `UndoEntry` enum that tracks both additions and deletions, so the full history is preserved when opening in the editor window.
- **Tool persistence** — the last-used drawing tool is now remembered across captures within the same session (was always resetting to arrow).

### Fixed
- **Bezier hit-test** — curved lines and arrows now use the cubic formula that matches NSBezierPath `curve(to:controlPoint1:controlPoint2:)`, so clicking near a bent arrow selects it correctly.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Editor window** — open any capture in a standalone editor window (`Open in Editor` button in the right toolbar). The window lives independently of the capture overlay: resize it freely, annotate, copy, save, pin, or upload without dismissing the overlay.
- **Crop tool** — editor window only. Click the `Crop` button in the top bar, drag a rectangle over the image, and release to crop. Annotations are automatically translated to the new origin. Zoom resets to 1× after cropping.
- **Zoom out below 1×** — in editor window mode, pinch or scroll below 1× to zoom out. Areas outside the image show a checkerboard pattern.
- **Top bar in editor window** — shows image size (px), a `Crop` button, the zoom level (click to type an exact value), and a reset-zoom button.
- **Dock icon while editor is open** — macshot shows a dock icon whenever one or more editor windows are open, so you can click it to bring them back. Icon disappears when all editors are closed.
- **Edit button in pin window** — a pencil button next to the close (✕) button opens the pinned image in a new editor window and closes the pin.
- **Smooth strokes toggle** — right-click the pencil tool to see a `Smooth strokes` toggle at the bottom of the menu (on by default). When enabled, finished pencil strokes are smoothed with Chaikin corner-cutting. Preference persists across restarts.

### Improved
- **OCR copy/paste** — `Cmd+C`, `Cmd+A`, `Cmd+X`, `Cmd+V`, and `Cmd+Z`/`Cmd+Shift+Z` now reliably work in the OCR results window.
- **Pin ownership** — pins created from an editor window are now owned by AppDelegate and survive the editor closing.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Zoom to cursor** — pinch or scroll now zooms toward the pointer position instead of the selection center
- **Pan while zoomed** — two-finger swipe pans the canvas when zoomed in
- **Click zoom label to set zoom** — click the zoom indicator pill to type an exact zoom level (e.g. `2`, `3.5`); Enter to apply, Escape to cancel
- **Cmd+0 resets zoom** — resets zoom to 1× from the keyboard

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-15

### Improved
- **Select & Edit tool** — arrow and line endpoints are now individually draggable handles instead of a bounding box; drag the midpoint handle to bend arrows and lines into curves
- **Loupe tool** — gradient border ring (light at top, darker at bottom) for a real lens look; new 320px size option; now magnifies existing annotations too (not just the raw screenshot)
- **Color picker in edit mode** — right-click color wheel and color picker now apply color to the selected annotation; previously only changed the current draw color
- **Font size changes** — no longer clips multi-line text or jumps the text box position; font size number in toolbar is now vertically centered
- **Pen tool** — single click now draws a dot (previously was discarded)
- **App icon** — regenerated all sizes from SVG at correct resolutions; no more blurriness in Finder/System Settings
- **Menu bar icon** — replaced SF Symbol with custom icon matching the app logo (corner brackets + shutter)
- **Liquid glass logo** — shutter blades and ring now use semi-transparent frosted glass effect with top-light gradient sheen

### Fixed
- **Circle/ellipse resize** — no longer flattens immediately when dragging a corner handle; all resize handles now work correctly regardless of draw direction
- **Marker/pencil selection** — bounding box and hit area now account for stroke width, so thick strokes are fully selectable
- **Color in edit mode** — right-click color wheel now shows when select tool is active; color changes apply to selected annotation

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Screen recording** — record any region of your screen as MP4 (H.264) or GIF. Select a region, click the record button in the right toolbar, and interact with any app normally while recording. Toggle **annotation mode** to draw on screen during recording. Stop with the stop button.
- **Annotation mode during recording** — while recording, toggle annotation mode to draw arrows, text, shapes, and other annotations on the live screen. Annotations appear in the recorded video.
- **Recording completed toast** — after stopping, a floating toast shows the filename with options to reveal in Finder or copy the file path. Auto-dismisses after 6 seconds.
- **Recording preferences tab** — configure output format (MP4/GIF), frame rate (15/24/30/60 fps), and what happens when recording stops (Show in Finder or do nothing).

### Improved
- **Preferences spacing** — tab content is now packed at the top instead of being spread across the full tab height.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Window snap mode** — hover over any window to highlight it with a blue border; click to snap the selection to that window's exact bounds. Drag as normal for a custom area. Toggle with `Tab`, capture full screen with `F`. Right-clicking a highlighted window performs a quick save/copy instantly. State persists via UserDefaults.
- **Live QR & barcode detection** — as soon as a selection is made or moved, macshot scans for QR codes and barcodes using Apple Vision. An inline bar appears below (or above) the selection with **Open** (URLs), **Copy**, and **Dismiss** actions. Redetects automatically when the selection changes.
- **Translation in OCR window** — translate extracted OCR text to any language directly in the results panel. Pick a target language from the dropdown, click **Translate**, toggle back with **Show Original**. Re-translates automatically on language change.
- **Background removal** — new toolbar action that uses Apple Vision's foreground instance mask to remove the background from a selection and copy the result as a transparent PNG (macOS 14+).

### Improved
- **Text tool** — `Enter` now inserts a new line (Shift+Enter no longer needed). Confirm text with the new green ✓ button; cancel with the red ✕. Switching to another annotation tool also commits text. Fixed long-standing position drift on multi-line text — switched to `draw(in:)` with the exact layout rect from the NSTextView layout manager.
- **Preferences rebuilt with AutoLayout** — entire Preferences window rewritten using `NSStackView` and AutoLayout. No hardcoded Y coordinates. All three tabs (General, Tools, Uploads) size and scroll correctly.
- **Uploads tab** — fully replaced broken scroll view with an AutoLayout-based list. Upload and delete URLs always visible and scrollable; Copy buttons aligned to the right edge.
- **Tools tab alignment** — second-column checkboxes use a fixed column width so they always align vertically.
- **Capture sound caching** — sound loaded once at startup (`static let`) instead of from disk on every capture, eliminating latency on quick save.
- **OCR Cmd+C fix** — copying text in the OCR results panel now works correctly; was previously beeping due to NSPanel focus issues.
- **Toolbar overlap fix** — bottom action bar no longer overlaps the right toolbar when the selection is near the top of the screen; repositions automatically.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Text Tool Overhaul**: Replaced basic text entry with an auto-resizing native text field that is single-line by default. Added `Shift+Enter` for multiline support.
- **Context Menus**: Added context menu support for toolbar tools. Right-click on drawing tools (pencil, line, etc.) or the beautify button to access their settings (stroke, color, or beautify styles), indicated by a small corner triangle.

### Improved
- **Square Selection Constrain**: Holding `Shift` while selecting an area now correctly constrains the selection to a perfect square.
- **Icon Updates**: Replaced the text tool icon with a cleaner `textformat` symbol. Also improved the main menu bar app icon with a larger scale.
- **UI Polish**: Vertically aligned the font size label with the +/- buttons for better aesthetics.
- **Marker Adjustments**: Fine-tuned the marker tool thickness and fixed text crop block sizing.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **Blur/Pixelate stacking**: Blurring or pixelating an already-blurred area now correctly operates on the composited image (including previous annotations) instead of the raw screenshot. Re-blurring now properly increases the blur effect instead of partially reverting it.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Right-click color wheel**: Right-click inside the selection while drawing to open a radial color picker centered on the cursor. Drag toward a color to select it, release to confirm. 12 preset colors arranged in a ring.
- **Middle-click move toggle**: Middle mouse button toggles Move Object mode on/off for quick access without clicking the toolbar.
- **Move Object cursor**: Open hand cursor when in Move Object mode instead of crosshair.

### Changed
- Move Object button moved to leftmost position in the toolbar with a subtle background tint to visually distinguish it from drawing tools.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Move Object tool**: Select and reposition existing annotations. Click to select, drag to move. Works with lines, arrows, rectangles, ellipses, pencil, marker, text, numbers, and measure lines. Button only appears when there are movable annotations. Pixelate and blur are excluded (position-dependent).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Upload to cloud**: Upload screenshots to imgbb with one click. Link auto-copied to clipboard, toast shows clickable link + delete button. Configurable API key in Preferences.
- **Measure tool**: Pixel ruler for measuring distances. Drag to measure, shows pixel dimensions with a label. Hold Shift to snap to horizontal, vertical, or 45° angles. Shows width × height breakdown for diagonal measurements.
- **Colored beautify style icon**: The style picker icon now matches the selected gradient theme color for quick visual identification.

### Changed
- Beautify mode and style now persist across sessions (remembered after toggling).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Full-screen capture via single click**: Left-click without dragging instantly selects the entire screen for annotation. Right-click without dragging performs a quick save/copy of the full screen.
- **Smart toolbar placement**: Toolbars now independently detect when they would go off-screen and move inside the selection. Works for any selection shape — full-width, full-height, or full-screen — not just full-screen rectangles.
- **Draggable toolbars**: Drag toolbar backgrounds to reposition them so they don't block areas you want to annotate.

### Changed
- Updated helper text to reflect single-click full-screen shortcuts.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Image format setting**: Choose between PNG (lossless, default) and JPEG with adjustable quality slider (10–100%) in Preferences. Applies to clipboard copy, file save, quick save, and screenshot history.
- **Disk-based screenshot history**: Recent captures are now stored as files in `~/Library/Application Support/com.sw33tlie.macshot/history/` instead of in memory. Zero RAM overhead, persists across restarts, and directory is created with owner-only permissions (0700).

## [1.2.7] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Memory usage**: Screenshot history now stores compressed PNG data instead of raw bitmaps, reducing memory from ~400 MB to ~30-50 MB with 10 entries. Floating thumbnail controller is also released after auto-dismiss instead of holding the full-res image until the next capture.
- **Color picker cursor**: Arrow cursor now shown over the color picker popup instead of crosshair.
- **Color picker indicator**: HSB gradient crosshair ring now tracks the actual mouse position accurately.
- **Selection visibility**: Fixed remaining case where the "Release to annotate" helper text disappeared at 1px selection dimensions.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Color picker cursor**: The cursor now switches to an arrow over the color picker popup (presets and HSB gradient) instead of staying as a crosshair.
- **Color picker indicator**: The crosshair ring on the HSB gradient now tracks the actual mouse position instead of reverse-computing from the selected color, which caused drift due to color space conversions.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Selection drawing**: Fixed remaining cases where the selection region and "Release to annotate" helper text would disappear when width or height was exactly 1px during drag.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Color picker positioning**: The color picker popup now flips above the toolbar when it would go off the bottom of the screen, and clamps horizontally to stay within display bounds.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-11

### Improved
- **Color picker**: Replaced the external system color panel with an inline HSB gradient picker. Click the rainbow "+" swatch to expand a hue-saturation gradient and brightness slider directly inside the toolbar popup — no separate window, no losing focus.

### Fixed
- **Selection drawing**: The overlay no longer disappears when the selection width or height is momentarily zero while dragging. The selection region stays visible throughout the entire drag.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-11

### Improved
- **Color picker**: Expanded from 12 to 23 preset colors in a 6-column grid, with extra shades and grayscale options. Added a rainbow "+" swatch that opens the macOS system color panel for picking any custom color.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-11

### Improved
- **Auto-Redact**: Much better credit card detection — now catches card numbers split across separate lines (e.g. "4868 7191 9682 9038" displayed as four groups), CVV codes, and expiry dates. Multi-pass detection with context awareness.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Auto-Redact**: One-click PII detection and redaction. Scans the selected region for emails, phone numbers, credit cards, SSNs, IP addresses, API keys, bearer tokens, and secrets — then covers each match with a filled rectangle. Fully undoable (Cmd+Z removes all redactions at once).
- **Delay Capture**: Timer button in the right toolbar lets you dismiss the overlay and re-capture after 3, 5, or 10 seconds — perfect for capturing tooltips, menus, and hover states. The selection region is preserved. Click to cycle through delays.
- **Right-click mode toggle**: New "Right-click action" setting in Preferences — choose between "Save to file" (default) or "Copy to clipboard".

### Fixed
- **Toolbar overlap**: Right toolbar no longer overlaps with the bottom toolbar when drawing narrow selections.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Right-click mode toggle**: New "Right-click action" setting in Preferences — choose between "Save to file" (default) or "Copy to clipboard". Helper text on the capture screen updates to reflect the selected mode.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Right-click quick save**: Right-click and drag to select a region and instantly save it as a PNG — no toolbar, no annotations, just a fast screenshot to disk. File is saved with the format `Screenshot 2026-03-11 at 16.09.19.png`.
- **Helper text on capture**: On-screen hints guide new users — idle screen shows left-click vs right-click instructions, and while dragging shows what happens on release (annotate or save to folder).
- **Configurable save folder**: Default save directory changed from Desktop to Pictures. Configurable in Preferences and used by both the Save button and right-click quick save.

### Fixed
- **Crosshair cursor**: Reliably forces the crosshair cursor on capture start, even when no window was focused.
- **Pixelate block size**: Pixelation blocks are now a fixed size regardless of selection area.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Crosshair cursor**: Reliably forces the crosshair cursor on capture start, even when no window was focused. Previous fix in v1.0.6 was insufficient.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Crosshair cursor**: The cursor now immediately switches to a crosshair when capture starts. Previously it could stay as a normal pointer until the mouse moved, especially when triggered via hotkey.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Pixelate block size**: Pixelation blocks are now a fixed size regardless of selection area, so redactions look consistent whether you select a small or large region.
- **Beautify tooltip**: Clarified the Beautify button tooltip so users understand what it does at a glance.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Blur Tool**: Real Gaussian blur annotation tool (next to Pixelate in the toolbar). Drag to select a region, blur is applied on release. Uses CIGaussianBlur with edge clamping for clean results.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Beautify Mode**: Wrap screenshots in a macOS-style window frame with traffic light buttons, drop shadow, and gradient background. Toggle with the sparkles button in the toolbar, cycle through 6 gradient styles (Ocean, Sunset, Forest, Midnight, Candy, Snow). Applied on copy, save, and pin — OCR always uses the raw image.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Screenshot History**: Recent captures are kept in memory and accessible from the "Recent Captures" submenu in the menu bar. Click any entry to re-copy it to clipboard. Configurable size (0–50, default 10). Set to 0 to disable.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **OCR Text Extraction**: New toolbar button to extract text from the selected area using Apple Vision framework. Results appear in a floating panel with copy, search, and word/character count.
- **Pin to Screen**: Pin any screenshot selection as a floating always-on-top window. Movable, resizable, with right-click context menu (Copy, Save, Close). Press Escape to dismiss.
- **Floating Thumbnail**: After capture, a thumbnail slides in from the bottom-right (like macOS native). Click to dismiss, drag to drop as a PNG file into any app. Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds. Toggleable in Preferences.
- **Capture Sound**: Plays the macOS screenshot sound on copy/save. Toggleable in Preferences.
- **Pixel Dimensions Label**: Selection dimensions (in pixels) shown above/below the selection at all times. Click to type an exact resolution (e.g. "1920x1080") and resize the selection.

### Changed
- Removed the size display toolbar button (replaced by the always-visible pixel dimensions label above the selection)
- Preferences window now includes toggles for capture sound and floating thumbnail
- Added "Made by sw33tLie" attribution with GitHub link in Preferences
