/// can only refract content from windows BEHIND it, never content in its own
/// window. The capture overlay draws the screenshot + dim mask in its own
/// window, so a glass toolbar placed inside it has nothing to refract. Hosting
/// the toolbar in this panel — ordered above the overlay — lets its glass sample
/// the overlay window beneath as its backdrop, producing real translucency.
///
/// The panel is kept TIGHT around the toolbar (not full-screen) so it only
/// intercepts clicks on the toolbar itself, leaving the rest of the overlay
/// interactive.
