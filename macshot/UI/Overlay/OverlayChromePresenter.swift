/// - Normal theme: the content view (a strip / options row) stays a subview of
///   the overlay and draws its own solid background. The presenter does nothing
///   except ensure no glass panel is active.
/// - Liquid Glass theme: the content is lifted into a floating child panel
///   (`OverlayChromePanel`) above the overlay, where an `NSGlassEffectView`
///   provides the translucent background (glass can only refract content from
///   windows behind it, so it must live in a separate window). While hosted, the
///   content's `hostedInGlassPanel` flag is set so it skips its own bg fill.
///
/// Everything else — layout (overlay-space rects), hit-test detection, cursor,
/// tooltips — is identical for both themes and lives in `OverlayView`, keyed off
/// the shared overlay-space rect. This presenter is the only topology branch.
